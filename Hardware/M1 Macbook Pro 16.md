The **Macbook Pro M1 Max (16 inch)** is my primary computer running #[[macOS]].

## Why I like it

- Great performance
- Great usability (macOS)
- Fantastic display
  - Fonts are beautiful to look at on the retina display
  - 16" in particular is sufficient to do real work without an external monitor (like [[LG Ultrafine 5k]])
- Good portability and battery life
  - Just the right size-performance for carrying elsewhere (eg: [[Coffee]] shops) and do real work.
