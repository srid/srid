# Become a hacker

> [!note] What is a "hacker"?
> In this context, "hacker" refers to someone who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming limitations and solving problems through programming. This is the original, positive meaning - not the malicious "cracker" stereotype often portrayed in media. A hacker is simply a skilled programmer who loves to tinker, learn, and build things with code. ([Source](http://catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html))

Programming lets you build cool stuff and solve problems with code. Whether you want to make apps, games, or art, it's a skill worth learning.[^1]

[^1]: The author was originally inspired by Eric S. Raymond's essay ["How to become a hacker"](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html), which provides a foundational perspective on the hacker (i.e., programmer) mindset and culture. The documentary ["Revolution OS"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0RYQVkQmWU) illuminates the hacker culture of that era.

## Foundations

I recommend starting by learning to create web apps using **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript** because it gives you quick visual feedback which can serve to motivate you better.

1. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/)
    - Choose a professional username you're comfortable with (you can always change it later if needed)
1. Enter [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
      - Sign in using your Github account 
      - Do the ["Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum"](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/)
1. Learn HTML, CSS & JavaScript in the above curriculum.
1. Connect with supportive communities
    - freeCodeCamp has an [online forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/), [Discord](https://chat.freecodecamp.org/) chat, and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp) with extensive tutorials

## Overcoming common challenges {#challenges}

**Imposter syndrome is normal** - Almost every programmer feels like they don't belong at some point. This feeling doesn't reflect your actual abilities or potential.

**You don't need to be a "math genius"** - While logic helps, programming is more about problem-solving and creativity than advanced mathematics.

**Start small and celebrate wins** - Every expert was once a beginner. Focus on progress, not perfection.


## Special interests

Once you have done the "Foundations" above, you may be interested in specialized aspects.

### Graphics & Game Development {#graphics}

If you're interested in games, animation, or visual programming:

- **Web-based graphics**: Start with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) for creative coding
- **Animation**: [Motion Canvas](https://motioncanvas.io/) for programmatic animations
- **Game engines**: Try [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) for 2D games or [Babylon.js](https://babylonjs.com/) for 3D games in the browser
- **3D graphics**: Learn [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for web-based 3D
