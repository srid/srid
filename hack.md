# Get into computer programming

Computer programming is an incredibly rewarding skill that opens doors to creativity, problem-solving, and endless possibilities. Whether you want to build apps, create art with code, or solve real-world problems, programming is for everyone - including you!

## Why programming is amazing

Programming allows you to bring your ideas to life, think logically, and create solutions that can impact millions of people. Many successful programmers started exactly where you are now, and the tech industry needs diverse perspectives and talents.

## Foundations

I recommend learning to create web apps using **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript** because it gives you quick visual feedback which can serve to motivate you better.

1. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/)
    - Choose a professional username you're comfortable with (you can always change it later if needed)
1. Enter [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
      - Sign in using your Github account 
      - Do the ["Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum"](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/)
1. Learn HTML, CSS & JavaScript in the above curriculum.
1. Connect with supportive communities
    - freeCodeCamp has an [online forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/) and [Discord](https://chat.freecodecamp.org/) chat

## Overcoming common challenges

**Imposter syndrome is normal** - Almost every programmer feels like they don't belong at some point. This feeling doesn't reflect your actual abilities or potential.

**You don't need to be a "math genius"** - While logic helps, programming is more about problem-solving and creativity than advanced mathematics.

**Start small and celebrate wins** - Every expert was once a beginner. Focus on progress, not perfection.
