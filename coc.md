# Harmlessness Code of Conduct

## Code of Conduct

(This document is based on [The Ruby Community Conduct Guideline](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/conduct/))

This document provides community guidelines for a safe, respectful, productive, and collaborative place for any person who is willing to contribute to the associated project. It applies to all “collaborative space”, which is defined as community communications channels (such as mailing lists, submitted patches, commit comments, etc.).

- Participants will be tolerant of opposing views.
- Participants must ensure that their language and actions are free of personal attacks and disparaging personal remarks.
- When interpreting the words and actions of others, participants should always assume good intentions.
- Behaviour which can be reasonably considered harassment will not be tolerated.

## Apolitical Stance

Politics not directly relevant to the project or community should not be discussed or mentioned in project spaces. We are here to enjoy working together on creating software (with [[equity-parity|equity and parity]], regardless of our background or identity) not to push personal politics onto others.[^1]


## Affective Stance

Ultimately, a "code" of conduct is only a guideline. Participants are encouraged to #[[Harmlessness|become harmless]] (i.e., being sans [[malice]]) in all of their interactions, for it will make such ethics and guidelines utterly redundant.

## Using this CoC

To use this CoC for your projects, add the following to the top of your `README.md`:

```markdown
[![Harmeless Code of Conduct](https://img.shields.io/badge/harmless-8A2BE2)](https://srid.ca/coc "This project follows the 'Harmlessness Code of Conduct'")
```


[^1]: The recent years have been seeing a #[[unwoke|decline]] in toxic [[woke|woke]] politics in tech spaces, which wokeness goes directly against the meritocratic and (actually[^2]) inclusive nature of those spaces. Any resurgence of attempts at [[woke-invasion|reversing this decline]] will not be tolerated, and the people involved will be asked to stop or leave, for the benefit of the rest of the community members.

[^2]: *actually*, as opposed to being a virtue signal or a [[Luxury beliefs|luxury belief]] only.
