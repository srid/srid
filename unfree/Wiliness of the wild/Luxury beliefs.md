[An article on 'luxury beliefs'](https://nypost.com/2019/08/17/luxury-beliefs-are-the-latest-status-symbol-for-rich-americans/) as being the class/status marker in this age:

> White privilege is the luxury belief that took me the longest to understand, because I grew up around poor whites. Often members of the upper-class claim that racial disparities stem from inherent advantages held by whites. Yet Asian Americans are more educated, have higher earnings and live longer than whites. Affluent whites are the most enthusiastic about the idea of white privilege, yet they are the least likely to incur any costs for promoting that belief. Rather, they raise their social standing by talking about their privilege.
> 
> \[..\] Because, like with diamond rings or designer clothes of old, upper-class people don a luxury belief to separate themselves from the lower class. These beliefs, in turn, produce real, tangible consequences for disadvantaged people, further widening the divide. Just as fashionable clothing will soon be outdated, so will today’s fashionable beliefs. In the future, expect the upper class to defame even more values — including ones they hold dear — in their quest to gain top-dog status.

It is not merely about '[[crt|white privilege]]' but as well the concept applies more generally to such a *class* of beliefs. From [Arjun](https://web.archive.org/web/20210922014844/https://www.arjunananthkrishnan.com/post/luxury-beliefs),

> having a stance on certain social issues can absolutely be a status-seeking measure.
> 
> \[..\] While I was in college, I was introduced to this idea that having a particular opinion on a social issue can be a means to confer status or signal something about yourself. This piece by Rob Henderson fits into that mental model.

While, in reality, it tends to be mix of status-signalling and [[Caring|actual concern]] over issues, [[woke|woke stances]] generally are of the mix wherein the former is predominant (hence the term "*virtue signalling*").
