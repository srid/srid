# Wokeism

**Wokeism** is a secular religion that originated in the United States of America, based on the pseudoscienfic field [[crt]]. It presumably took roots around 2016 (see [[woke-invasion]]) and has been withering away since around 2024. Bigoted ideologies like [neoracism](https://johnmcwhorter.substack.com/p/the-elect-neoracists-posing-as-antiracists) fall under wokeism. The central thesis of the religion--and thus what "woke" means--is best characterized by the following passage:

This influence just gives the illusion of change by activism and [[Armchair philosophising|armchair philosophizing]], when, in reality, it’s the same ol’ fight of the opposites (male vs. female, proletariat vs. bourgeois, and so on) ...

> RICHARD: Speaking of ‘*the illusion of change by activism*’: what I have noticed, whilst pottering around the world-wide-web, is that those of a sinistral statist ideology (such as your ‘*marxism/ postmodernism/ feminism*’ wording is suggestive of) are apparently [[woke-psychology|extracting meaning and/or purpose]]# from busying themselves in the redressment of systemic cultural ‘wrongs’, via the [[govt-censorship|heavy hand of state compulsion]], through retaining [[censorship|tight control of ‘the public narrative]]’ – having long-ago seized the high moral ground of minority-group injustice (as per your ‘*fighting for the rights of the vulnerable classes*’ words) – on a yet-to-be-demonstrated premiss that an equitable society can be legislated into existence (i.e., imposed on all citizens at the point of state-owned/ state-controlled guns), in a ‘majority-rules’ society, on a ‘minorities-rule’ basis.
