[The Formation and Persistence of Social Identity](http://actualfreedom.com.au/an/various/persistentsocialidentity.htm):

> This sexualised gender-identity became socio-politicised when ‘gender feminism’ and ‘[[woke|identity politics]]’ in particular gained traction due to clamorous ‘anti-discrimination’ vocalists and vociferous ‘equalitarian’ activists stridently cashing in on their minoritarian victimology socio-politico influence and its resultant lobbying pressure [..]

> What is implicit, in this twenty-first century _“social constructs”_ psychosexuality, is how the days of merely relating as a ‘boy’ and a ‘girl’ or as a ‘man’ and a ‘woman’ (depending on sex and age) are increasingly becoming as if a bygone era due to nothing other than the sexualisation of those otherwise straightforward boy-girl and man-woman classifications such as to increate those [[Identity|phantasmal]] ‘gender identities’, or ‘sexual orientation identities’, in accordance with sexual persuasion and amative predilection (as distinct from existing-in-fact-and-actuality anatomical and chromosomal identifiers).

> In other words, all the fuss and pother dominating current-affairs about 101-plus personal pronouns – made regulatory law, even, in some fiefdoms (e.g., the Canadian regulatory kerfuffle over Prof. Jordan Peterson et alia) – as well as males asseverating gender-dysphoria competing in women’s sports, and nondiscriminatory access to public toilets and change-rooms,  and the suchlike, along with the antisemitic-style taking offence laws and/or regulations (as in ‘hate-speech’ laws), promulgated and promoted by the unelected and unaccountable United Nations bureaucrats and rapporteurs, stems from and revolves cyclonically around none other than this [[Identity|phantasmal]] _“social construct”_ of a gender-identity (a.k.a. _“sexual orientation identity”_ as explained in detail on pages 4-5 of the August 2009 “Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation” paper from the ‘American Psychological Association’, August 2009, in the mouse-hover tool-tip further above).
