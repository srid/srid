  - [Kafkatrapping, by esr](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=2122)
    - *The aim of the kafkatrap is to produce a kind of free-floating guilt in the subject, a conviction of sinfulness that can be manipulated by the operator to make the subject say and do things that are convenient to the operatorâ€™s personal, political, or religious goals. Ideally, the subject will then [internalize] these demands, and then become complicit in the kafkatrapping of others.*
