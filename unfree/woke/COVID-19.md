> The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most manipulated infectious disease events in history, characterized by [[misinformation|official lies]] in an unending stream lead by government bureaucracies, medical associations, medical boards, the media, and international agencies. We have witnessed a long list of unprecedented intrusions into medical practice, including attacks on medical experts, destruction of medical careers among doctors refusing to participate in killing their patients and a massive regimentation of health care, led by non-qualified individuals with enormous wealth, power and influence.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9062939/
