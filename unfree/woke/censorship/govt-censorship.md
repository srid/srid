Allen Farrington [writing on Quillette](https://quillette.com/2021/01/20/big-tech-and-regulation-a-response-to-the-quillette-editors/) (Jan 20, 2021):

> [...] A simpler thesis would be that the reason so much of “Big Tech” spontaneously coordinated [to [[censorship|censor]]] as it did was a **political calculus** aimed at avoiding onerous regulation by currying favour with the incoming administration.

> [...] For years, Zuckerberg has begged Congress to craft a set of rules for him to follow concerning online speech. Among tech executives, he is not alone in his **discomfort** with shouldering responsibilities that seem to border on governance
