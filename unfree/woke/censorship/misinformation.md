# "Misinformation"

- "When you hear the word "misinformation", substitute with "wrongthink". It makes much more sense that way." --[Alexandros Marinos](https://twitter.com/alexandrosM/status/1488594317895614464)
- "the most frequent and destructive sources of disinformation are the largest media corporations that pretend to fight it" --[Glenn Greenwald](https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1492864130579107843)
- "We found that participants who report being more worried about misinformation are more willing to like and share alarmist narratives on misinformation." --via *People believe misinformation is a threat because they assume others are [[Gullibility|gullible]]* https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/14614448231153379
- > We are living in confusing times—much has been said about the impact of social media on how people perceive “truth”, the rise of fake-news and so on. The rise of AI poses yet another threat to our informational system with even more potential for spreading inaccurate information. It is understandable that people want to cling to security and a higher authority. And it is seductively tempting to succumb to the lulling serenade of “experts”, who, like siren voices in a summer wine ballad, promise to soothe our worries to rest, only to beguile us into surrendering our judgment in the intoxicating haze of the “latest science” (which has nothing to do with STEM). I fear that the field of misinformation studies may largely be a thinly-disguised endeavour to seize power and to dictate the boundaries of public discourse and thought. https://twitter.com/RuxandraTeslo/status/1731304626014560472
