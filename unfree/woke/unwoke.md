# Undoing Woke Invasion

:::{.page-note .bg-blue-50 .border-2 .border-blue-700 .pt-4 .px-4 .shadow-md}
For the [[Caring|actually caring]] (ie. not [[Luxury beliefs|pseudo-caring]]) readers who are looking to do good in the world without the artifice of woke ideology, the author recommends looking into [[Harmlessness|becoming harmless]].
:::

The first step to resist or undo [[woke-invasion]] in your organization (or [your psyche](https://archive.is/rUiwZ#selection-187.47-205.10)) is to thoroughly understand its creed [[crt]], so as to uncover the fact that generally speaking woke disciples care [[Luxury beliefs|less]] about the problems in the world than assuaging their self-centered ideological feelings.[^mhg] The next step, obviously, is then to effectuate an elimination of the wannabe woke invaders from your organization by instituting a culture based on common sense values stripped of identity politics.

[^mhg]: It is vital to realize that the woke really have no moral high ground. They are as corrupt ([[woke-psychology|psychologically speaking]]) as the groups they criticize.
    > A lot of people still think all these [woke] folks are 'nice but misguided'.
    > 
    > No. Some are. Especially the younger ones.
    > 
    > But a lot of [[malice|malicious]], wicked people hide under the 'social justice' umbrella and take glee in hurting others. Emotionally and physically. Then they play victim. https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1644199998496677889

## Case studies

### Organizations

A sample of tech companies successfully extricating themselves out of [[woke-invasion]] is presented below. What level of diplomacy you choose in your tactic is up to you; Brian Armstrong (Coinbase) and DHH (Basecamp) were demonstrably more diplomatic than Jesse Powell (Kraken).

- **Coinbase**: [Coinbase is a mission focused company](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804)
	- Brian Armstrong, in Oct 2022 (2 years latter): “It was one of the best things I’ve ever done for the company because now we’re fully aligned, making faster progress, and everybody who joins the company knows what they’re signing up for.” ([The Tim Feriss Show](https://twitter.com/FrankAFetter/status/1740951131755524193))
- **Basecamp**: [Summary by u/Amadanb](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/n3pe45/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_may_03_2021/gwwj9vm/?context=3&sort=best)

	- DHH, in Apr, 2023: "It's far easier to stand up to the [woke] golems today than it was a couple of years ago. At least in the realm of business. (Things still look pretty rough in academia!)" -- [Standing up to golems](https://world.hey.com/dhh/standing-up-to-golems-c98dd4a8)
  	- sriramk (quotting DHH and others), in Jan, 2024: "There is a vibe shift." -- https://twitter.com/sriramk/status/1742270488427041105
  	- DHH in podcast with sriramk, in Jan,  2024: https://twitter.com/sriramk/status/1750221074900328602?t=1388

- Alexandr Wang at **Scale**:
  > There is a mistaken belief that meritocracy somehow conflicts with diversity. I strongly disagree. No group has a monopoly on excellence. A hiring process based on merit will naturally yield a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and ideas. Achieving this requires casting a wide net for talent and then objectively selecting the best, without bias in any direction. We will not pick winners and losers based on someone being the “right” or “wrong” race, gender, and so on. It should be needless to say, and yet it needs saying: doing so would be racist and sexist, not to mention illegal. https://x.com/alexandr_wang/status/1801331034916851995

### Individuals

If there is one case study that I must pick as my favourite, it would be that of Grace.

- **Grace**: a report of how she resisted [[woke-invasion]] in her non-profit organization in around year 2010, through clearly understanding [[crt]].

{#expose}
## Expose them

You may then publicly expose[^no] the woke charlatans, as these do:

[^no]: Quoting John McWhorter from [We must say no to these people](https://world.hey.com/dhh/we-must-say-no-to-these-people-e0fb301c), "*It is natural to fear going up against the parishioners who so fervently disagree, with their ten-dollar words and artful sarcasm and air of surety. But I promise you: There is room in this society for speaking the truth and living to tell about it.*".

Well, at least [this black person](https://mooseyanon.medium.com/github-f-ck-your-name-change-de599033bbbe) would have told them that calling the branch master is not offensive. Furthermore, black people as a collective are not triggered by words like master wherever they appear in the wild. Context people, context. [[censorship|Banning]] a word because you think it’s offensive is basically telling us what we should and should not be offended by. There are bigger problems around inclusivity that deserve our time, let us put this drive for change into those.
