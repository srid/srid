## AI summary

In 2021, **Jon Pretty**, a prominent Scala community leader and conference organizer, faced sexual harassment allegations from two ex-partners: **Yifan Xing** and **Victoria Leontieva** (killnicole). They accused him of non-consensual acts, manipulation, and exploiting his position during conferences, detailed in blog posts. An open letter signed by over 300 community members demanded boycotts of his events and software, leading to his "cancellation," job loss, and project shutdowns. Pretty denied the claims, asserting consensual relationships that ended poorly.
Community reactions split: supporters praised public callouts due to legal barriers for victims; critics decried mob justice and lack of due process. Notably, accuser Leontieva was then-girlfriend of **Travis Brown** (known for Scala cancel culture tactics), and Xing is his current girlfriend.

In 2024, Pretty sued four UK-based open letter signatories for libel. They settled out of court, admitting no evidence for allegations, paying Â£5,000 damages plus costs, and apologizing for harm caused.

In 2025, Pretty detailed the fallout: severe financial losses, emotional trauma, and lasting career damage, criticizing the community's dereliction of due process. Discussions highlighted broader risks of false accusations and community toxicity.
