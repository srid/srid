A modern philosophical movement that had its origins in the likes of Mr. Eliezer Yudkowsky (of the 'LessWrong' fame), known for its members' rather excursive[^ex] style of writings resulting from hyperfocus on cognition and blindness to [[free|affect]].

Being [[Wiliness of the wild|artful]] often takes the form of [[Armchair philosophising|armchair]] sophistry[^sop] ("gish gallop" for instance) in rationalists. Like anyone with an [[Identity|identity]], [[Native intelligence|native intelligence]] does not always operate and function cleanly and clearly on the movement's members, despite well-meaning efforts and intentions.

### Effective Altruism (EA)

EA proponents generally care more about, say, [[Vegan Propaganda|animal rights]] than the [[free|mental health]] of their fellow humans. See Kathleen Stock's article [Effective altruism is the new woke](https://unherd.com/2022/09/effective-altruism-is-the-new-woke/):

> Effectively, both longtermism and [[woke|woke progressivism]] take a highly restricted number of emotional impulses many of us ordinarily have, and then vividly conjure up heart-rending scenarios of supposed harm in order to prime our malleable intuitions in the desired direction. Each insists that we then extend these impulses quasi-rigorously, past any possible relevance to our own personal lives. [..]
> 
> What is perhaps particularly scary about the longtermists, as opposed to the other lot, is not that they are driven by emotion, but that they don’t know they are. [..] Grand-scale fantasies of saving the world are easy. Personal relationships are hard.

## People skeptical of rationalists

- [Alexandros Marinos](https://twitter.com/search?q=rationalists%20from%3AalexandrosM&src=typed_query) -- who is also known to have gotten into [argument with](https://nitter.net/alexandrosM/status/1533327207795335168) Mr. Scott Alexander (yet another '[[Authority|authority]]' in this movement, commanding its denizens [what to think](https://doyourownresearch.substack.com/p/scott-alexandriad-iii-driving-up?s=r)).

[^sop]: See [this tweet](https://twitter.com/karlprosser/status/1479528095426113538) for one way of expressing this sophistry:

    > [..] “sophisticated” thinkers often have just build layers of thought/words/rationalizations on top of the same emotions as everybody else.
    > 
    > [..] emotion driven arguments can be articulately woven with the form and vocabulary of rational norms
