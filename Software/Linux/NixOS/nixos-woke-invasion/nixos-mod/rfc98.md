# RFC 0098 (Nix)

https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/98

This much-criticized RFC was opened by an *"asexual autistic trans-femme plural system"*[^profile] named Irene Knapp to codify an already-existing process in NixOS moderation, to wit:

- *"To form the initial team, the founding members will be appointed by Graham at his sole discretion."* and
- *"The team's focus should be on developing leadership from within, not on bringing in experienced people from outside. This is important to maintaining ideological continuity."*

It should be noted that the person pushing for this RFC is an ex-Google employee[^profile] who, per [a Business Insider story from 2019](https://www.businessinsider.com/irene-knapp-google-organizer-is-leaving-over-burnout-retaliation-2019-9), made *"activism their “full-time job,” in part, by advising and helping support organizing efforts throughout the tech industry."*. The same story provides a little more background on their motives:

> At Google, Knapp co-authored a safe-workplace petition that gathered over 2,500 hundred signatures, [leading to new rules](https://www.wired.com/story/google-tries-new-rules-to-curtail-harassment-of-employees/) within the company against the employee harassment and guidelines as to what information could be shared on internal forums. Knapp also spoke out at a number of annual shareholder meetings, including one in 2018 when they called for [Google executive’s performance](https://www.businessinsider.com/google-engineer-irene-knapp-calls-out-board-on-diversity-2018-6) to be tied to the company’s overall diversity metrics.
