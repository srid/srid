# NixOS Woke Invasion

#[[woke-invasion|Woke invasion]] of the [[NixOS|NixOS]] #[[Community|community]] can be traced back to as early as [April, 2021][origin]. It appears to have reached its zenith in April, 2024 when the woke moderation team's mischieves [reached the public eye](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40166912).

On May 1st, 2024, the Board decided to delegate powers to an unspecified "community" (see "Eelco steps down" below), however it remains to be seen as to what exactly this will engender.

### Resignation

Just a few hours after the PR for RFC 175 was opened, several moderators began to resign from the team:

As of May 2nd, this leaves `hexa` and the newly-joined `lassulus` as the only moderators.
