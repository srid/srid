# Humanity Unorthodox

This is a different kind of index into the [Actual Freedom website][AFTweb] that acts as an easy 'portal', and as well as serves as atomic notes (of [[Zettelkasten]] kind) for linking to from elsewhere.

Start from [[Actualism Method]] if you wish to get to the nitty-gritty of what this is all about (the method is to segue into the "actualism process"; [[Out from control]]) ... or browse the various notes below.

NOTE: These notes may not be always up-to-date. Consult the [Actual Freedom website][AFTweb] for that. These notes primarily serve the purpose of being a quick reference to the author, and secondarily of providing potentially serendipitous benefits to any passerbys. An atom feed is provided, which you can monitor in a [feed reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_aggregator).
