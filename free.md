# Humanity Unorthodox

An **Actual Freedom** (i.e., "[[Identity|self]]"-immolation) makes everything else so blasÃ© in comparison, as nothing else offers the ultimate and thorough betterment of humanity. This section of my website is a different kind of index into the [Actual Freedom website][AFTweb] that acts as an easy 'portal', and as well as serves as atomic notes (of [[Zettelkasten]] kind) for linking to from elsewhere.

Start from [[Actualism Method]] if you wish to get to the nitty-gritty of what this is all about (the "method" is to segue into the "[[Out from control|actualism process]]" which culminates in "[[Identity|self]]"-immolation) ... or browse the various notes below.

>[!info]  Purpose
> These notes primarily serve the purpose of being a quick reference to the author, and secondarily of providing potentially serendipitous benefits to any non-[[unfree|conforming]] passerbys.

>[!warning] Requires Update
> These notes may not be always up-to-date. Consult the [Actual Freedom website][AFTweb] for that. The author plans to revamp this part of the site at some point in the future.
