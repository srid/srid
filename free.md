# Humanity Unorthodox

An **Actual Freedom** (i.e., "[[Identity|self]]"-immolation) makes everything else so blasé in comparison, as nothing else offers the ultimate and thorough betterment of humanity. This section of my website is a different kind of index into the [Actual Freedom website][AFTweb] that acts as an easy 'portal', and as well as serves as atomic notes (of [[Zettelkasten]] kind) for linking to from elsewhere.

Start from [[Actualism Method]] if you wish to get to the nitty-gritty of what this is all about (the "method" is to segue into the "[[Out from control|actualism process]]" which culminates in "[[Identity|self]]"-immolation) ... or browse the various notes below.

NOTE: These notes may not be always up-to-date. Consult the [Actual Freedom website][AFTweb] for that. These notes primarily serve the purpose of being a quick reference to the author, and secondarily of providing potentially serendipitous benefits to any non-[[unfree|conforming]] passerbys.
