## Create your own Nostr identity

Just as mine above, you can use a DNS-based internet identifier if you own a domain, using [NIP-05]. This works on clients like [Satellite.earth]. It is fairly to simple to configure; just add a `.well-known/nostr.json` (see [mine](https://github.com/srid/srid/blob/master/.well-known/nostr.json)) to your site.
