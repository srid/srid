# Pop!\_OS

https://system76.com/pop

Pop!\_OS is better than [[Omarchy]] for two reasons:

- Excellent *hybrid* tiling experience
- Recognises all peripherals (webcam, mic, sound) of [[Apple Studio Display]]

## Reports

- [Oct 1, 2025](https://x.com/sridca/status/1973583560671125589): Pop!\_OS works on both [[Beelink SER8]] and [[ThinkPad P14s]]

## Gotchas

- **COSMIC Store** often installs Flatpak apps which brings their own downsides.
	- For e.g., Flatpak version of Google Chrome prevents 1Password extension for communicating with the desktop app
 - Night Light is not yet supported, but [there is a workaround](https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-epoch/issues/476)
