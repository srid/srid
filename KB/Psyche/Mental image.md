A **mental image**, in the context of the [[Psyche]], is the internal, psychic representation we form of another person. It is the "story" or [[Belief|belief]]-structure we create _about_ someone, composed of our own emotions, judgments, past experiences, and projections.

This mental image is a **psychic apparition**. Just as the [[Identity]] is an illusory "I" or "me" to represent one's own host body, it is also an illusory "them" to represent another.

## The Image vs. The Person {#vs}

It is crucial to distinguish this mental image from the actual, _flesh & blood_ human being it supposedly represents. The mental image is not the person; it is a construct _within our own_ psyche.

We do not see people as they are. We see the mental images we have created of them. These images are built from:

- **Projections:** We attribute our own unconscious feelings, beliefs, or motives to the other person.
    
- **Transference:** We redirect feelings and attitudes from past relationships (like parents) onto the person in our present.
    
- **Past Experiences:** We filter their current actions through the lens of our past encounters.
    
- **Social Identity:** We perceive them through the lens of group affiliations (our "group" vs. their "group").
    

## A Source of Conflict {#conflict}

This is one fundamental reason for human conflict ([[malice]]). We almost never interact directly with the other person. We interact with _our mental image_ of them.

When we feel anger, attachment, or resentment towards someone, we are, in reality, experiencing an affective reaction to _our own psychic apparition_ of that person. The subsequent conflict is not between two flesh & blood humans, but between two illusory [[Identity|identities]]â€”our "I" fighting the "you" we have created.

We are, in effect, only ever interacting with modified parts of ourselves.

## Related concepts {#related}

- **Stereotyping:** This is a form of this process, but at a group level. You interact with your mental image of "a \[group member\]" instead of the specific individual in front of you.
- **Preconception/Assumption:** These words describe the content of the mental image (the _idea_ you formed) before interacting.
