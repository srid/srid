### Secondary disturbances {#sec}

From the above PDF:

> Another unique feature of REBT is its recognition of the importance of working with ‘secondary disturbances’, that is, ==problems about problems== (e.g. feeling guilty about being angry, or anxious about becoming anxious)
>
> [..] Sometimes [..] the secondary disturbance ==needs to be addressed before== the primary problem becomes accessible to change.

From https://albertellis.org/2015/01/addressing-embarrassment/

> A secondary disturbance or meta-disturbance is defined as an emotional problem ==about== an emotional or behavioral problem. 

> Practitioners of REBT are very much in tune with secondary disturbances, and it may be clinically indicated to ==address these first==, in order to successfully assist with the primary emotional disturbance.

In regards to having fun with secondary disturbances, see also [[Naivete]]:

> After all, embarrassment ==can be fun too==, and laughing at your mistakes and shortcomings while still working on them is a rational, and by consequence, functional alternative to self-downing.
