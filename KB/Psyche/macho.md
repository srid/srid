> The **macho** (or male chauvinist, or manly man) is a strutting factotum with bulging biceps, stone-dry eyes, brains that are ruled by his gonads, and an ego indoctrinated to believe that he is the lord -and master of the woman who rules him. His [[Psyche|psyche]] is primed to defend his woman's supposed honour from other men's advances. Thoroughly conditioned to serve women, his life satisfaction comes from [[Trust|loyally]] serving his nest queen. Naturally, he is the matriarchist's ideal man. When young, he suffers from the delusion that he is stronger, cleverer, and naturally superior to the woman who controls him. However, an older and wiser macho, if obliged to confess the truth, might say: *"I am the captain of this ship, and I have the permission of my wife to say so."* But by then, it is too late for him to be anything but a habitual macho.

- *"When this woman says "[men] were made to conquer", what she's expressing is her tacit desire to raise a race of what Chinweizu calls "machos" (and they are gullible enough to fall for it)."* https://x.com/sridca/status/1981371903735382232
