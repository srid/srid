> [!NOTE] [From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-consciousness)
>  "self-consciousness" has commonly come to refer to a preoccupation with oneself, especially with how others might perceive one's appearance or one's actions. An unpleasant feeling of self-consciousness may occur when one realizes that one is being watched or observed, the feeling that "everyone is looking" at oneself. Some people are habitually more self-conscious than others. Unpleasant feelings of self-consciousness sometimes become associated with [shyness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shyness "Shyness") or [paranoia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoia "Paranoia").
