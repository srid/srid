I used to own an **iPad Pro** (11 inch). It was useful particularly in the following ways (compared to doing the same on [[M1 Macbook Pro 16|a macbook]]):

- Brainstorming using the [Freeform](https://www.apple.com/ca/newsroom/2022/12/apple-launches-freeform-a-powerful-new-app-designed-for-creative-collaboration/) app
- Reading books

The iPad pencil on the other hand usually does not see much use. Overall, I've come to realize that tablets are not very useful to me in the long-run. They are little more than a toy that seems short-term use.
