I have a 4TB Samsung T7 SSD.

## Cons

- Regressing to abysmal write speeds. See [reports on reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/16x7j8v/samsung_t7_external_ssd_extremely_slow_like_3mbps/).
	- Workaround: leave the SSD connected while writing a large file. Normal write speeds resume in a while.
