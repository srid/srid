The **MacBook Pro M1 Max (16 inch)** is my primary computer running #[[macOS]].

## Why I like it

- Great performance
- Great usability ([[macOS]])
- Fantastic display
  - Fonts are beautiful to look at on the retina display
  - 16" in particular is sufficient to do real work without an external monitor
      - However, an external monitor (like [[LG Ultrafine 5k]]) does make a huge difference.
- Good portability and battery life
  - Just the right size-performance tradeoff for carrying elsewhere (eg: [[Coffee]] shops) and do real work.
      - That said, 13" MacBook Air wins over in regards to portability.
