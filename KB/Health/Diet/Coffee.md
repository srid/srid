# Coffee ☕️

A good tasting coffee makes all the difference. Fortunately, despite a [[Carnivore diet|restrictive diet]] I'm still allowed to coffee.

> [!TIP] Current method
> I've vastly simplified my coffee making methods: Aeropress + pre-ground [Illy coffee](https://www.amazon.ca/illy-Ground-Coffee-Moka-Preservatives/dp/B0BX4PZRRK/). Brew with 14g coffee + 80g boiling water. Then add more (slightly colder) water to dilute for 'lungo' strength.

> Coffee snobs' grinding recommendation never made as consistently a good tasting coffee as this!

## Moka pot

Get a 3-cup Bialetti or equivalent, which produces about ~60g of espresso that can be diluted to make a 100g drink. You can actually use pre-ground coffee without fret; notably, I've had good experience with [Illy Intenso Dark Roast](https://www.illy.com/en-ca/coffee/ground-coffee/ground-espresso-intenso-coffee-dark-roast/A060ST.html) coffee.

You may have to tamp the grounds: https://x.com/sridca/status/1916970293912080880

## Espresso

## Aeropress

### Essential equipment

Invest in these:

- **Aeropress**
- Scale (0.1g precision)
- Brew kettle with precision thermometer
  - I use Fellow Stagg
- A good burr grinder 
  - ~~I use Niche Zero home; and Comandante when travelling~~
  - I have the fantastic [[J Ultra]] grinder both for home espresso and travel purposes. 

### Dialling

When coffee tastes bad, change one or more of these factors. It may take several attempts to get it right.

- Grind size 
  - Get a good burr grinder![^h]
- Water temperature 
  - higher for light roasts; lower for dark roasts
  - even a +/- 5f adjustment can make a difference
- Coffee to water ratio
  - I generally do not vary this, and keep it fixed at 10:100g.
- Change to a new coffee matching your preferred flavour in the [flavour wheel](https://atlanticspecialtycoffee.com/wp-content/uploads/SCA_TasterWheel_English_8.5x11.pdf)[^myf]

Generally speaking, you mainly want to vary grind size and/or water temperature.

[^myf]: I enjoy flavours towards chocolate/sugar side of the spectrum, which tends to come from medium to dark roasted coffee from certain regions (like Brazil Santos).

[^h]: If getting a manual hand grinder, note the the way of grinding [may matter](https://old.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/lkazl5/hand_grinder_use_ive_been_doing_it_all_wrong/).

### Aeropress brew methods

How I typically make coffee:

#### Inverted Aeropress recipe

- Invert the Aeropress
- Add 15g of coffee
- Water temp at 165f-190f (depending on beans)
- Start timer; pour about 50g; and stir until ~30 seconds
- Pour rest, total 150g.
- Brew until about 2 minutes
- Gently but consistently press for ~30seconds

If you use fresh coffee with your preferred flavour profile, and select the right grind size and water temperature for those beans - expect this method to consistently produce a great cup of rich coffee that is equivalent in strength to what the [Québécois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois_people) call [café allongé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lungo).

## Kalita Wave 155 recipe

> [!warning] Questionable success
> This recipe has usually not been very successful -- probably because I tend to use espresso blends?

- 10g of coffee
- 185-194f water temp (depends on beans)
- 35g pour, wait 35 secs.
- Pour rest, total 135g. Wait till water comes through.

## Beans

Good beans can be bought from:

- Online from [iDrinkCoffee](https://idrinkcoffee.com/). 
- Yirgacheffe from [Caprice d'Alice](https://lescapricesdalice.com/)

## Learnings / experimentation

- Eating (creamy) butter in between cups helps 'reset' taste receptor.
    - But eating a meal is ideal.
- One day, I want to try roasting coffee myself
