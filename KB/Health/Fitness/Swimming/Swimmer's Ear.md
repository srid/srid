## Head ache

Takes a few minutes after waking up for the uncomfortable sensation to start from the affected ear, and progress towards all of head - which [[Head ache]] then continues unabated until evening.

## Anecdotal reports {#anecdotes}

- A cafÃ© owner I know reported that she often gets swimmer's ear (simply due to water getting into ears), which takes her 3 weeks to resolve (first two weeks being worst) on its own without medication.
