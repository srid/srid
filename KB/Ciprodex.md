> -   **Ineffectiveness of Ciprofloxacin Drops for Resistant Infections:** The study concluded that using ciprofloxacin drops to treat bacteria that are resistant to ciprofloxacin is ineffective. The high concentration of the antibiotic achieved in topical drops was found to be insufficient to overcome the bacteria's resistance.
> -   **Low Success Rate:** In patients with ciprofloxacin-resistant infections, treatment with topical ciprofloxacin drops alone had a success rate of only 2.7%.
> -   **Alternative Treatments Were More Successful:**
> 	-   Non-ciprofloxacin topical drops had a much higher success rate, with a 70% cure rate.
> 	-   When an oral antibiotic was added to the topical ciprofloxacin drops, the success rate increased significantly to 64.7%.
> 	-   Oral antibiotics alone had a 70% success rate for these resistant infections.
> -   **Common Resistant Bacteria:** The most common bacteria causing these ciprofloxacin-resistant infections were Methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA) (33%), *Corynebacterium striatum* (19%), and non-Methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (11%).
