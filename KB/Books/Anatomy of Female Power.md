**Anatomy of Female Power** is a book by the Nigerian essayist #[[Chinweizu Ibekwe]] portraying the precise role of **covert female power** in #[[Sex Identity|gender]] dynamics of [[Psyche]].

> [!QUOTE] AI summary
> The book's entire premise is that women _already_ rule men and that "matriarchy" is the true, hidden power structure in human society. The "favors" men provide are not just incidental but are the entire basis of the social order, which Chinweizu argues is designed to turn men into "nest-slaves".

## Three types of men {#men}

> [!QUOTE] Quote from the book
> [..] in their attitudes to women, there are three basic types of men: the [[macho]], the **musho**, and the **masculinist**. A macho is a brawny, and sometimes brainy, factotum who has been bred for nest slavery, and who is indoctrinated to believe that he is the lord and master of the woman who rules him. A musho is a henpecked version of the macho who hangs like a bleeding worm between the beaks of his nest queen. A masculinist is a man who is devoted to male liberty, and who would avoid nest slavery.

- _The Manipulated Man_ by Esther Vilar
	- Written in 1971, Vilar's work makes the identical case: that women are not oppressed but are, in fact, the oppressing class. She argues that women condition men from boyhood (using praise, emotional blackmail, and the strategic use of [[Sexuality|sex]]) to become "slaves" who work to provide for them. This aligns perfectly with Chinweizu's concepts of "motherpower," "bridepower," and "wifepower."
- _The Myth of Male Power_ by Warren Farrell
	- While Chinweizu argues women have hidden power, Farrell argues that what we _call_ male power (patriarchy) is actually a form of male _disposability_. He reframes "power" as "control over one's own life." By this metric, he argues that men, who are traditionally obligated to be protectors (the draft, dangerous jobs) and providers (working longer hours), are the powerless sex, leading to shorter lifespans and higher suicide rates. It directly attacks the same feminist premises as Chinweizu but with a different set of evidence.
- [[Is There Anything Good About Men?]] by Roy F. Baumeister
	- This book by a prominent social psychologist examines history and culture to argue that societies (both men and women) have always exploited men for the good of the group. Baumeister's thesis is that culture "uses" men by promising them status and "the girl" in exchange for them creating, achieving, and dying in war or high-risk endeavors. It supports the "male disposability" thesis and argues that men's lives are treated as more expendable than women's.
