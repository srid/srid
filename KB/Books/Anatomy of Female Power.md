**Anatomy of Female Power** is a book by the Nigerian essayist #[[Chinweizu Ibekwe]] portraying the precise role of **covert female power** in #[[Gender Identity|gender]] dynamics of [[Psyche]].

> [!QUOTE] AI summary
> The book's entire premise is that women _already_ rule men and that "matriarchy" is the true, hidden power structure in human society. The "favors" men provide are not just incidental but are the entire basis of the social order, which Chinweizu argues is designed to turn men into "nest-slaves".

## Three types of men {#men}

> [!QUOTE] Quote from the book
> [..] in their attitudes to women, there are three basic types of men: the [[macho]], the **musho**, and the **masculinist**. A macho is a brawny, and sometimes brainy, factotum who has been bred for nest slavery, and who is indoctrinated to believe that he is the lord and master of the woman who rules him. A musho is a henpecked version of the macho who hangs like a bleeding worm between the beaks of his nest queen. A masculinist is a man who is devoted to male liberty, and who would avoid nest slavery.
