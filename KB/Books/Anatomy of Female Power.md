## Three types of men {#men}

> [!QUOTE] Chinweizu
> [..] in their attitudes to women, there are three basic types of men: the [[macho]], the **musho**, and the **masculinist**. A macho is a brawny, and sometimes brainy, factotum who has been bred for nest slavery, and who is indoctrinated to believe that he is the lord and master of the woman who rules him. A musho is a henpecked version of the macho who hangs like a bleeding worm between the beaks of his nest queen. A masculinist is a man who is devoted to male liberty, and who would avoid nest slavery.
