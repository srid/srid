The human psyche is a bundle of emotions & [[Belief|beliefs]]# forming one's [[Identity]] (which includes [[Social Identity]]#).

Various affective[^affect] perceptions of the world are components of this psyche:

- The "I" or "me" one thinks and feels oneself to be
- Any "group" one *belongs* to
	- Including the largest group, "humanity"

These entities ("I", "me", "group", "humanity") *are* the psyche or identity—as in they are all one and the same thing.[^humanity] They are nothing more than *psychic apparitions*, as distinct from the *flesh & blood* human bodies they supposedly represent. They are the ultimate cause of all human suffering ([[malice]] and [[sorrow]]). Despite not being real (actual), they feel *very very real* to the 8 billion human beings on the planet.

The death of this illusory psyche entails [[Altruistic self-immolation]]#, and an abeyance of it results in a [[PCE]].

## Characteristics

- An identity occupying one host body can [[Affective Vibes|involuntarily transmit]] its affect[^affect] contents to other identities occupying other host bodies regardless of distance.

[^affect]: Affect is the underlying experience of feeling, emotion or mood.

[^humanity]: 
	From [Richard’s Selected Correspondence On Addiction](https://actualfreedom.com.au/richard/selectedcorrespondence/sc-addiction.htm),
	> RICHARD: I should have put scare quotes around the word humanity as the word itself can refer to two different things: in its all-humankind meaning it is a more comprehensive word for what the word group refers to (which ranges through family, band, clan, tribe, race, nation and species) and, just as the group’s survival traditionally takes precedence over an individual’s survival, the group’s fears of not surviving have priority over an individual’s fears of not surviving. When fear comes into the picture, however, **the word humanity no longer refers to all people collectively but takes on a life of its own, as it were, and becomes an entity in its own right in the same way ‘I’ am an entity inside the flesh and blood body**.
    > 
    > And just as ‘I’ suffer because ‘I’ exist (suffering is ‘my’ very nature) ‘humanity’ suffers because it exists (suffering is very nature of ‘humanity’) and thus a virtue is made out of suffering because the survival of ‘humanity’ is at risk ... hence the taboo on escape
    > 
    > Yet **‘humanity’ has no existence outside of the human psyche**.
