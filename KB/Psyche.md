slug: psyche

The human psyche is a bundle of emotions & beliefs forming one's [[Identity]] (which includes [[Social Identity]]).

Various affective[^affect] perceptions of the world are components of this psyche:

- The "I" or "me" one thinks and feels oneself to be
- Any "group" one *belongs* to
	- Including the largest group, "humanity"

These entities ("I", "me", "group", "humanity") *are* the psyche or identityâ€”as in they are all one and the same thing. They are nothing more than *psychic apparitions*, as distinct from the *flesh & blood* human bodies they supposedly represent. They are the ultimate cause of all human suffering ([[malice]] and [[sorrow]]). Despite not being real (actual), they feel *very very real* to the 8 billion human beings on the planet.

The death of this illusory psyche entails [[Altruistic self-immolation]]#, and an abeyance of it results in a [[PCE]].

## Characteristics

- An identity occupying one host body can [[Affective Vibes|involuntarily transmit]] its affect[^affect] contents to other identities occupying other host bodies regardless of distance.


[^affect]: Affect is the underlying experience of feeling, emotion or mood.
