# Synopsis of Actualism

>[!info]  About This Page
> The following description of the actualism [[Actualism Method|method]] & [[Out from control|process]] is based on Srid's **ongoing** understanding which is **still** developing, since May of 2024. Consider them as draft being edited from time to time before a final version is ready and gets published (expected to be around the time Srid becomes free).

Resurrect and allow [[Naivete|naiveté]] to flourish more and more while paying attention to "your" tendency to arrogate/ re-establish/ re-enact control (arrogating actualism words even), which (combined) acts as a good foundation to build [[Felicity and Innocuity|enjoyment and appreciation]] of [[This Moment|this moment]] ... to the point of, naturally, allowing yourself to get as close (aka. intimate; cf. [link](https://discuss.actualism.online/t/kub933s-journal/467/1391)) to people, things ***and*** events (***as they happen now***, rather than anywhen/ anywhere else). [[Sincerity|Sincerely]] acknowledge and [[On-the-job real-time experiencing|explore]] any issue or feeling standing in the way.

With the more exciting feelings out of the way, fear of [[sorrow]], depression and/or boredom may take their place. Just sit still, appreciate [[This Moment|this moment]] even if it appears ordinary or empty; allow appreciation to expand.

In effect, "you" are mimicking the actual world, where it is always only [[This Moment|this moment]] ever.
