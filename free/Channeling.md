# Channeling of instinctual passions

> [!cite/richard] [Richard’s Selected Correspondence On Delight](https://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/selectedcorrespondence/sc-delight.htm)
> 
> The [[Felicity and Innocuity|felicitous/ innocuous feelings]] are in no way docile, lack-lustre affections ... in conjunction with [[Sensuousness|sensuosity]] they make for an extremely forceful/ potent combination as, with ==all of the affective energy channelled== into being as happy and harmless as is humanly possible (and no longer being frittered away on [[Love|love]] and compassion/ [[malice]] and [[sorrow]]), the full effect of ‘me’ at the core of ‘my’ being – which is ‘being’ itself – is dynamically enabled for one purpose and one purpose alone.

> ALAN: _Can you expand on ‘instinctually driven’. Do you mean that having experienced what is possible, there ain’t no other high – where do the ‘instincts’ come in?_
> 
> VINEETO: With pleasure. I have spent wonderful hours on the balcony the other night, watching the sky and listening to the different sounds of the night while contemplating about all the different instincts that I have encountered and learnt to understand on the path to freedom. So this is what I have come up with:
> 
> **Fear** – We all know it at nauseam; it includes trickery, cunningness, numbness, confusion, escape, denial, excuses, guilt and beliefs in all kinds of good (helpful) and bad (harming) spirits. And, of course, there are panic, terror and good old dread and the escape into enlightenment. But ==fear is also the doorway to [[Courage of your convictions|courage]], thrill and excitement== to reach closer and closer to one’s destiny.
> 
> **[[Aggression|Aggression]]** – Besides physical attack, aggression has many more subtle nuances: blaming, resentment, verbal abuse, nagging, boredom, being the victim, arrogance, clever-clever, competition, self-destruction and revenge. I made use of this instinct for becoming free as a ==bloody-mindedness, persistence, not to ‘let the buggers get me down’ and refusal to run with the crowd==.
> 
> **Nurture** – It took me a while to wade through the ‘good’ feelings and emotions down to the basic instinct of nurture instilled to preserve the species. All the romantic movies thrive on nurture to tug at one’s heart strings, both with the heroic man and the loving but helpless woman. The willingness to kill and die for love for country, justice and religion is continuously adding to the 160,000,000 killed in wars this century alone. Further you find this instincts thriving on all kinds of NDA beliefs and action by attempting to ‘save endangered species’, ‘care for Mother Nature’. When leaving the fold of humanity, I found that I am moving away from this instinct of nurture – the collective belief in the ‘good’.
> 
> It is useful for freedom as the sincere intent to ==have peace-on-earth not only for me but for humanity as well and to sacrifice my ‘self’ for that goal==.
> 
> **Desire** – With desire we collect things and strive for power and improvement for ‘survival’ – ceaselessly and endlessly on the go. In the spiritual world this desire is turned into the search for enlightenment, the ticket to immortality and power in the ‘other-world’.
> 
> Now I come to the point that I was making: ‘For me, a vital drive has been the – instinctually driven – ==searching for the ultimate achievement==...’ I experienced it as the instinct of desire that has driven me to search for freedom, to clean myself up, to ==be the best ‘I’ can be==.
