> RICHARD: The stillness of time itself is ascertained [[Apperception|apperceptively]] (unmediated perception).
> 
> RICHARD: The stillness of time itself, being a property of that arena (so to speak) in which events occur, is an essential property of this actual world ... the world of this body and that body and every body; the world of the mountains and the streams; the world of the trees and the flowers; the world of the clouds in the sky by day and the stars in the firmament by night and so on and so on ad infinitum.
> 
> RICHARD: ... the stillness of time itself has been experienced by countless peoples during pure consciousness experiences ([[PCE|PCE]]’s).
