[What is the Meaning of Life](http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/sundry/frequentquestions/FAQ01a.htm),

PETER: If ‘I’ seek meaning for ‘my’ life then narcissism can be the only result – and the long history of the famed spiritual search attests to this fact. If ‘I’ simply reject the [[Social Identity|traditional meanings]] of life then meaninglessness aka nihilism can be the only result and this seems to be where U.G. Krishnamurti has ended up.

The meaning to life is not to be found in the feeling-fed continuity ‘I’ call ‘my life’, for a [[PCE|PCE]] confirms that the meaning of life is to be found only when ‘I’ exit the stage as it were.
