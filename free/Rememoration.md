slug: rememoration

From [listd38](http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/listdcorrespondence/listd38.htm),

[Richard]: Thus, in conjunction with those ‘making present’ words [i.e., ‘presentiate’, ‘presentially’, and etcetera], I now have the linguistic means to vividly communicate how feeling-being ‘Richard’ (...) utilised that rememorative-presentiation process to imbue/ suffuse ‘his’ day-to-day life with the ambience/ the flavour/ the appeal of the [[PCE]] and thus invigorate and vitalise ‘his’ moment-to-moment experiencing as well. (Although, due to the total lack of precedence, ‘he’ increasingly infused it with the grandeur/ the glory / the allure of the ASC as well). [endquote].

[RICHARD: I am resurrecting and introducing several obscure and/or obsolete words so as to facilitate communication](http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/listdcorrespondence/listdclaudiu3.htm),

RICHARD: [..] by dint of a viscerally-felt instinctually-intuitive rememoration (‘re-’ + ‘memoration’) of memorable experiencing already memorialised in the memorative facility – revivified feelingly therein and thereby infused presentially[^p] with luminous vibrancy when brought thus anew into consciousness – any such indelibly-impressed experience comes freshly into present conscious existence by that rememorative function itself.

[^p]: presentially (ad.): in a way which supposes actual presence.
