# Excellence Experience

> "*‘excellent’ related to richness (a near-absence of agency; with the doer abeyant, and the beer ascendant, being the experiencing is inherently cornucopian)*"

> RICHARD: [as to] how the intimacy experience (IE) differs from an **excellence experience** (EE): qualitively they are much the same, or similar, insofar as with both experiences there is a near-absence of [[Identity|agency]] – the beer rather than the doer is the operant – whereupon [[Naivete|naïveté]] has come to the fore, such as to effect the marked diminishment of separation, and the main distinction is that the IE is more people-oriented, while the ==EE tends to be environmental in its scope==.
> 
> In other words, with an EE the ==‘aesthetic experience’== feature, for instance, or its ‘nature experience’ aspect, for example, tends to be more prominent, whilst with an IE the ‘fellowship experience’ characteristic, for instance, or its ‘convivial experience’ quality, for example, comes to the fore. In either type of near-[[PCE|PCE]] – wherein the experiencing is of [[Being the doing of what is happening|‘my’ life living itself]], with a surprising sumptuosity, rather than ‘me’ living ‘my’ life, quite frugally by comparison, and where [[This Moment|this moment]] is living ‘me’ (instead of ‘me’ trying to live ‘in the moment’) – the diminishment of separation is so astonishing as to be as-if incomprehensible/ unbelievable yet it is the imminence of a fellow human’s immanence which, in and of itself, emphasises the distinction the most.
>
> For instance, the degree of intimacy experienced with minera, flora and fauna upon strolling through some botanical gardens with either near-PCE occurring – as in, with rocks, trees and birds, for example – is to the same gradation as when in a social setting such as a typical sitting room situation (as in, with ashtrays, flowers and humans, for instance) yet it is the ‘fellow human being’ element which exemplifies the already astounding diminishment of separation which ensues upon the blessed onset of this near-innocent intimacy of naïveté.
>
> And that latter point – the felicitous advent of naïve intimacy – is another way the IE differs from the EE inasmuch if a near-PCE is initiated via intensive interaction with a fellow human being/ with fellow human beings it takes on the properties of an intimacy experience (IE) whereas if the near-PCE is triggered via ==interacting intensively with the world at large== (as in, an aesthetic experience, a nature experience, a [[Pure Contemplation|contemplative]] experience, for example) it takes on the properties of an **excellence experience** (EE).
