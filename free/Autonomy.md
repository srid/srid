> RICHARD: Again, no. I am==completely and utterly autonomous== ... I do not need anyone to satisfy some lack in me. Thus I free the other from ‘my’ graceless demands.
> 
> I experience no fear whatsoever ... which does away with the need for [[Trust|trust]], faith, [[Hope|hope]] and [[Belief|belief]]. This is my on-going experience twenty four hours a day, year after year.

> My experience is that autonomy leads to neither isolation nor ostracization as I feared it would at some stage, but if it is pursued [[Curiosity-Fascination-Obsession|diligently and persistently]] it ==leads to an actual [[Grace's scale|intimacy]] and ease== with all of my fellow human beings – and I, once again, experienced the peace on earth that already, always exists.

> For me, the key was to stop expecting or demanding that other people behave how I thought they should behave, to stop imposing my moods and whims on others, to stop obliging the whims and moods of others, to stop expecting or demanding of others what I was unwilling or unable to give.
> 
> The magic outcome of this process is that one eventually ceases to expect anything of anyone else – then you can never feel let down, [[Disappointment|disappointed]], obligated, grateful or [[Basic Resentment|resentful]]. This cleaning yourself up – eliminating your [[Social Identity|social]] and instinctual identity – leads to a ==delicious and tangible autonomy==. You become ==delightful company==, both happy and harmless, free to interact with all of your fellow human beings in a way that is always appropriate, for you are [[Naivete|guileless, innocent – childlike]] but with all the benefits of life experiences and a passion-free benign clarity.

> The key ingredient for feeling-being ‘Vineeto’ was, when ‘she’ investigated the pining aspect of [[Love|love]], ‘her’ childhood-inspired romantic dream of belonging to a man and therefrom having an iron-clad identity as a woman ([A Bit of Vineeto, \#love](https://actualfreedom.com.au/actualism/vineeto/vineeto.htm#love)). Seeing this fact, thus abandoning the romantic dream, and ==reclaiming ‘her’ autonomy==, was only the beginning of a longer process of weening ‘herself’ off the whole maze of female identity and man-woman relating in general.
> 
> [..] If this fact, that [[Love|love]] will not solve your problem of aloneness and loneliness, is allowed to sink in, as an irrefutable fact, love will lose its appeal and you can ==regain your autonomy and dignity as a person in your own right== – and simultaneous ==recognize your partner’s own autonomy and dignity==. It also dispenses with pining and jealousy in one fell swoop.
> 
> With ==autonomy and dignity restored== you can then [[Naivete|naively]] relate to your fellow human beings in an increasingly intimate way, unilaterally. I know from experience how much a woman can appreciate [[Grace's scale|intimacy]], even though she may not know that this is really what she is looking for when she says she wants [[Love|love]]. You will find out yourself when you proceed interacting with your partner in an intimate rather than loving way.

> VINEETO: One thing that I particularly didn’t like about falling in [[Love|love]] was the pining. Whenever I was not with Peter I felt **I was tied to him on a long elastic cord and not able to fully enjoy whatever I was doing by myself**. Digging into what could be the reason for my pining, I discovered what I call the ‘Cinderella-syndrome’ – **the romantic dream that most women have** about the perfect and noble man. We are not only looking for someone who takes care of us when our own strength fails us, but also for someone who gives perspective, meaning, definition and identity to our lives, be it as father of our kids, provider of social status, security or a purpose for life. According to this dream Peter should be the answer to the question which I wasn’t willing to face myself: ‘What do I really want to do with my life?’ I remember a Monday evening after a weekend together, and I had been pining the whole day. I had not enjoyed work as I found myself struggling to get out of this exhausting dependency. Here I was, **44 years old and as silly as a teenager!** After work I took a long walk across rolling hills into a spectacular sunset, trying to work out what I wanted to do with my life. (...). That very evening the situation changed. My pining stopped. The fog in the head cleared. **My expectations disappeared. I could again stand on my own feet and equally enjoy the time when I was by myself.** I had ==**recovered my autonomy**== – my autonomy in the sense that I am the only one in my life who is responsible for my happiness
