RESPONDENT: Does responsibility and [[Seriousness|seriousness]] come with being carefree?

RICHARD: No, the utter reliability of being always [[Felicity and Innocuity|happy and harmless]] replaces the onerous burden of being responsible ... and actuality’s blithe [[Sincerity|sincerity]] dispenses with the gloomy [[Seriousness|seriousness]] that epitomises adulthood.

It is funny – in a peculiar way – for I often gain the impression when I speak to others, that I am spoiling their game-plan. It seems as if they wish to search forever ... they consider arriving to be [[Boredom|boring]]. How can unconditional peace and happiness, twenty-four-hours-a-day, possibly be boring? Is a carefree life all that difficult to comprehend? Why persist in a sick game ... and defend one’s right to do so? Why insist on suffering when blitheness is freely available here and now? Is a life of perennial gaiety something to be scorned? I have even had people say, accusingly, that I could not possibly be happy when there is so much suffering going on in the world. The logic of this defies credibility: Am I to wait until everybody else is happy before I am? If I was to wait, I would be waiting forever ... for under this twisted rationale, no one would dare to be the first to be happy. Their peculiar reasoning allows only for a mass happiness to occur globally; overnight success, as it were. Someone has to be intrepid enough to be first, to show what is possible to a benighted humanity.

One has to face [[Courage of your convictions|the opprobrium of one’s ill-informed peers]].
