> RESPONDENT: Does ==responsibility== and [[Seriousness|seriousness]] come with being carefree?
> 
> RICHARD: No, the utter reliability of being always [[Felicity and Innocuity|happy and harmless]] replaces the onerous burden of ==being responsible== ... and actuality’s blithe [[Sincerity|sincerity]] dispenses with the gloomy [[Seriousness|seriousness]] that epitomises adulthood.

> It is funny – in a peculiar way – for I often gain the impression when I speak to others, that I am spoiling their game-plan. It seems as if they wish to search forever ... they consider arriving to be [[Boredom|boring]]. How can unconditional peace and happiness, twenty-four-hours-a-day, possibly be boring? Is a carefree life all that difficult to comprehend? Why persist in a sick game ... and defend one’s right to do so? Why insist on suffering when blitheness is freely available here and now? Is a life of perennial gaiety something to be scorned? I have even had people say, accusingly, that I could not possibly be happy when there is so much suffering going on in the world. The logic of this defies credibility: Am I to wait until everybody else is happy before I am? If I was to wait, I would be waiting forever ... for under this twisted rationale, no one would dare to be the first to be happy. Their peculiar reasoning allows only for a mass happiness to occur globally; overnight success, as it were. Someone has to be intrepid enough to be first, to show what is possible to a benighted humanity.

> **RICHARD:** I laugh a lot ... there is so much about life, the universe and what it is to be a human being [[living in the world as it is with people as they are|living in the world as-it-is]], sans ‘I’ as ego and ‘me’ as soul, that I find irrepressibly ludicrous.

> **RESPONDENT:** _But there is something that is serious in your reply._
> 
> **RICHARD:** No, there is nothing _[[Seriousness|‘serious’]]_ in what I do or say – [[Sincerity|sincere]] yes – but _‘serious’_? No way ... life is too much fun to be serious (in order for there to be seriousness there must be ==an in situ responsibility==).
>

> **RESPONDENT:** _Oh my, didn’t you learn that it is a lot of fun to take things seriously?_
> 
> **RICHARD:** No ... surely you are not really suggesting that it is _‘a lot of fun’_ (‘fun’: playful, humorous, comical, amusing, entertaining, pleasurable) to be _[[Seriousness|‘serious’]]_ (‘serious’: solemn, staid, stolid, sombre, grave, stern, grim)?
