# Awareness-Cum-Attentiveness; Aware-Cum-Attentive

http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/abditorium/apperception.htm

This hyphenated neologism – a term which includes being [[Affective Awareness|affectively aware]] in combination with, and as felt necessary thereby, being cognitively attentive (the Latin cum=with, together with, or along with, as in ‘a garage-cum-workshop’, for instance) – was coined in order to more readily reference an adroit technique which involves a keenly discriminative [[Affective Awareness|affective monitoring]] of the quality of mood plus the cognitive rectification of same, and as [[On-the-job real-time experiencing|instigated responsively‌ therefrom]], so as to effect beneficial modification of one’s day-by-day temperament which, in the longer-term, brings about a benefactive transformation of disposition and/or character as well. Any necessity to be (cognitively) attentive only takes place on those occasions when/ where an otherwise ongoing (affective) enjoyment and appreciation diminishes – which attentiveness is initiated by that [[Diminishment|diminution]] in the quality of (affectively) enjoying and appreciating being alive/ being here, each moment again, come-what-may – and occurs less and less once one gets the knack of thus (affectively) monitoring one’s moment-to-moment mood and temperament via the increasingly subtle variations in that quality.
