RICHARD: By ==neither expressing nor repressing emotions==, something new can happen. The emotion is **put into a bind**, it has nowhere to go. Next time anger, say, comes up in a situation, simply [[decline]] to have it happen. Observe it as it gets up to all kinds of tricks to have its way. Do not express it – but do not repress it either. Watch what happens ... you will be surprised. Personally, I rid myself of anger in about three weeks when I started on this all those years ago. The more subtle variations like getting peeved, getting irritated and getting annoyed took a little longer, but losing my temper in an angry outburst ended after about three weeks. I kid you not. It all has to do with the determination to succeed, with patience and diligence born out of the pure intent garnered from a [[PCE|peak experience]]. You just know that it is possible to be peaceful because you have seen it for yourself. One will do whatever is required to be that experience, twenty-four-hours of the day.

Here we can start afresh. Here we can have success.

VINEETO: For me to ==keep my hands in my pocket while neither repressing, nor expressing nor acting upon== my feelings but allowing myself to feel the feeling in order that I could be [[Aware-Cum-Attentive|attentive]] to the nature of the particular feeling whilst it is happening was extremely sensible advice. This allows me to put the **feeling in a bind** – it is like holding the feeling under a microscope rather than letting it go unobserved or letting it run rampant as is normally the case.

[Peter]: The expression I heard Richard use was to ==‘keep your hands in your pockets’==, meaning be wary of doing something you may regret while in the midst this period of psychological and psychic turmoil. The process can be very confusing and disorienting for one is demolishing one’s own [[Spirituality|spiritual]]/ [[Social Identity|social]] and one’s instinctual identity – something any good psychiatrist would warn you against and something your priests and Gurus will utterly condemn as being evil. It may be useful to ask questions such as – am I trying to change the other, am I blaming the other, is my reaction considered and considerate or is it thoughtless instinctual? One’s own interactions with others provide a literal goldmine of valuable information as to how the human psyche is socially and instinctually programmed.’ I spoke to No 7 just a while ago about a recent experience with fear. There is no need to really go into all of it right now, but in light of what you wrote, the advice to ‘keep your hands in your pockets’ is sensible. I do regret acting unwisely in the situation. I did become somewhat aggressive. I recall the supervisor saying that I was ‘defensive’. [endquote].
