> RICHARD: In [[Aware-Cum-Attentive|attentiveness]], there is an unbiased **observing of the constant showing-up** of the ‘reality’ within and is examining the feelings arising one after the other ... and such attentiveness is the ending of its grip. Please note that last point: in attentiveness, there is an observance of the ‘reality’ within, and such attention is the end of its embrace ... finish.

> RICHARD: The most effective way to investigate all the [[Belief|beliefs]], ideas, theories, concepts, maxims, dictums, truths, factoids, philosophies, values, principles, ideals, standards, credos, doctrines, tenets, canons, morals, ethics, customs, traditions, psittacisms, superstitions, myths, legends, folklores, imaginations, divinations, visions, fantasies, chimeras, illusions, delusions, hallucinations, phantasmagoria and any other of the schemes and dreams and mores which constitute social conditioning is the hands-on moment-to-moment approach – the ==**on-the-job real-time experiencing** where all the real-life people, things and events are currently occurring in a real-world context – rather than [[Armchair philosophising|armchair philosophising]]==.

> If one asks oneself, each moment again, how one is experiencing this moment of being alive (which is the only moment one is ever alive) all will be revealed in due course, in the bright light of [[Aware-Cum-Attentive|awareness]], as one goes about one’s normal life. Moreover, all the instinctive drives, urges, impulses, compulsions, demands, pressures, cravings, yearnings, longings – all the instinctual passions which necessitate social conditioning in the first place – will be laid bare with the perspicacity born of pure intent and thus open for examination.

> RICHARD: [..] Provided your answer to No. 5, in either instance, is in the affirmative you will now be back to enjoying and [[Appreciation|appreciating]] this moment of being alive (the only moment you are ever alive) and thus the prospect of seeing the fact which will set you free of the belief will be facilitated by being able to come upon it **experientially** ... it is your **active** participation/ presence which vitalises/ invigorates the investigation/ exploration.

> In short: [[Armchair philosophising|armchair philosophising/psychologising]] will get you nowhere ... and fast.

> VINEETO: Undertaking an exploration of one’s own feelings **when and as they are occurring** – becoming [[Curiosity-Fascination-Obsession|fascinated]] with the business of being alive – is the means to developing [[Apperception|apperceptive awareness]], a prerequisite to becoming free of the human condition itself.

> VINEETO: First stop fighting the fear when it arises and **allow, in the experiencing of it, to get the information you need** in order to get back to [[Feeling good|feeling good]]. When feeling good – with less emotional interference – you can think about what you have read and found sensible and apply the advice that makes sense to you. If it works to minimize your suffering, continue, if not contemplate again and identify what other triggers keep you from feeling good.
