> RICHARD: Two things immediately leap to mind ... (1) you value feeling worry (a feeling of anxious concern) over feeling good (a general sense of well-being) ... and (2) you have not really seen it is silly to feel bad (a general sense of ill-being). What I would suggest, at this point, is to **feel the silliness of feeling bad** (in this case feeling anxiety) ... then the seeing (as in a realisation) might very well have the desired effect (as in an actualisation) of once more [[Feeling good|feeling good]].

> 
> If so, do you further comprehend that anytime you felt [[Feeling good|good]]/will feel good does not mean a thing if you are not feeling good now ... that a remembered occasion/an anticipated occasion pales into insignificance if you are feeling bad now?
> 
> Furthermore, do you understand that to be living [[This Moment|this moment]] – the only moment you are ever alive – by feeling bad is to be frittering away a vital opportunity to be fully alive ... to totally [[Felicity and Innocuity|enjoy and appreciate]] being what you indubitably are (a sensate creature) whilst you are here on this planet?
> 
> If so, is it not silly to waste [[This Moment|this only moment]] you are ever alive by feeling bad ... when you could be [[Feeling good|feeling good]]?
