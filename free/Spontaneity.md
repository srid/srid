> I function organically – as in uncontrolled – inasmuch I am pragmatic/practical (as contrasted to principled/logical) ... and, again, utility and effectivity in any given situation/ circumstances is what determines such functioning.
> 
> In short: ==there is nothing which needs to be controlled ... hence spontaneity== (no impulsivity).

> RESPONDENT: Do you just execute what bubbles up – from wherever – spontaneously?
> 
> RICHARD: There is a ==marked distinction betwixt spontaneity and impetuosity== (aka impulsiveness) ... acuity and/or perspicacity, in the applied form of discrimination, discernment (as in being expedient, provident, judicious, prudent) in conjunction with pragmatism, practicality, sensibility, simplicity, and so forth, gives ready access for any introspective/creative process to take place.

> With no identity in situ/ no affective faculty extant, to stuff things up, it is all quite effortless.

> It is all so ==spontaneous==, in the actual world; I do not do it – it does itself. Vanity, egoism, selfishness – all self-centred activity has ceased to operate when ‘I’ as ‘me’ being ceased to be.

> RICHARD: Can he remember any [[PCE|pure consciousness experiences]]? Can he remember experiencing a moment – or moments – wherein everything falls into place correctly and perfectly? Wherein everybody, oneself included, and everything, is utterly pure? There is an ambience of total peace and harmony. ==Kindliness and spontaneous generosity of character come spontaneously and easily==.

> RICHARD: And here you have put your finger on the nub of the issue: the ==spontaneity of [[equity-parity|equity and parity]]== that comes with the recognition of being fellow human beings is hijacked, subverted, sabotaged. And by what?

> PETER: There is a crystal clear clarity, a vibrant physicality to things. Objects are seen to be not passive, dead or dull, for they are all fashioned from the material of the universe and fashioned by the only intelligent life forms in the universe – human beings – and one marvels at the ingenuity of that intelligence. Not only do things become things to wonder at, but everyday events have an ==unrehearsed spontaneity== that is [[Curiosity-Fascination-Obsession|fascinating]] to be a part of.

> PETER: [..] if you look at the computer monitor that you are reading these words on you will see that it has three spatial dimensions – width, length and depth – and that your observation of this is happening in this moment. The ==very spontaneity and instantaneity of [[This Moment|this very moment]]== gives vibrancy to the things and events that one [[Sensuousness|sensately]] experiences in [[This Moment|this moment of time]]. In short, in actuality, [[What is time|time]] is not a fourth dimension, space and time are not a continuum, space is not bent, nor is it expanding – all of these concepts and theories are nought but impassioned (subjective) fantasies.
