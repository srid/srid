# Srid's 2025 Ballina visit

I'm visiting Vineeto in Ballina, where I'll be staying for 3 months until June.

## Published Video Recordings {#videos}

Below you'll find some of the actualism-relevant videos I'm recording, and publishing on [[Twitter|X]], during this trip. While there's no expectation that I'll talk about every subject, I do find that there's value (not only, potentially, to viewers but also to myself) in expressing myself through means other than text. 

2025-04-06: [Being here now](https://x.com/sridca/status/1908659248319652192)
: *Being here now* as map-less simple way of actualism. Paying *attention* to all the instances—especially fear (see below)—when straying off the path (of being here now). This video does not talk about the following, which Srid may get to talk about in future:
	- The whole category of fear, involved in distracting (dissociating) one away from being here now.
	- Recognizing the core of 'myself' in these passions & emotions, and being that, then liking 'myself' (thus naive)
	- Naiveté: being likeable and liking (liking 'myself' and everything/everyone, as well as others, potentially, liking 'me')
	- Being naiveté itself: when "I" _am_ naive as a default persona.
