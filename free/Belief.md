> RICHARD: Etymologically, belief means: ‘fervently wish to be true’, and actual means: ‘already occurring; existing as factually true’.
>
> RICHARD: [..] etymologically the word ‘believe’ is derived from the Old English ‘geliefa’ (belief, faith) from the West Saxon ‘geliefan’/ ‘beliefan’ (to believe, [[Trust|trust]]) from the Germanic ‘galaubjan’ (to hold dear, esteem, trust) 
>
> RICHARD: [..] By its very nature a belief is not factually true ... otherwise it would not need to be believed to be true. A fact is obvious; it is out in the open.
