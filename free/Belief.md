> ### **1. Core Definition and Etymology**
> 
> Richard defines "belief" not merely as an opinion, but through its etymological roots, specifically meaning to "fervently wish to be true". He traces the word back to the Old English and Germanic roots meaning "to hold dear," "esteem," or "love". Consequently, he characterizes belief as an "emotion-backed thought" rather than a purely intellectual position.
> 
> ### **2. Belief vs. Fact and Actuality**
> 
> The text draws a sharp distinction between belief and fact:
> 
> - **Mutually Exclusive:** A belief is described as something that is not factually true; if something were a fact, it would be obvious and would not require belief to exist.
> - **Passionate Imagination:** The action of believing is defined as "emotionally imagin[ing] something to be real that is not actual".
> - **Independence of Reality:** Actual things (such as the physical universe, the sun, or a tree) exist independently of anyone's belief in them.
> - **Faith Required:** Belief is inextricably linked with faith, [[Trust|trust]]#, and [[Hope|hope]]#, all of which are discarded in "actualism" in favor of confidence and certainty born of direct experience.
> 
> ### **3. The Identity as Belief**
> 
> In this context, the concept of "belief" is tied directly to the human sense of [[Identity|identity]] (the ego or soul):
> 
> - **The "I" is a Belief:** Richard asserts that the "I" or "me" is itself a belief, arising out of the act of believing.
> - **The Believer is the Believed:** One cannot simply drop beliefs while maintaining a self-identity, because [[Believing in itself|"the believer is the believed"]].
> - **Physiological Basis:** A flesh and blood body without the "affective faculty" (identity/emotions) is incapable of believing; it can only experience facts.
> 
> ### **4. The Function and Consequence of Belief**
> 
> - **Social Conditioning:** Beliefs are viewed as "psittacisms"—mechanical repetitions of received ideas and social conditioning—rather than autonomous reasoning. See [[Social Identity]].
> - **Source of Suffering:** Beliefs are described as the "bane of humankind," responsible for historical wars, torture, and guilt.
> - **Obstacle to Peace:** Beliefs (including religious, spiritual, and materialist beliefs) are seen as obstacles that prevent the direct experience of the actual world, which is already perfect and peaceful.

>
> RICHARD: Etymologically, belief means: ‘fervently wish to be true’, and actual means: ‘already occurring; existing as factually true’.
>
> RICHARD: [..] etymologically the word ‘believe’ is derived from the Old English ‘geliefa’ (belief, faith) from the West Saxon ‘geliefan’/ ‘beliefan’ (to believe, [[Trust|trust]]) from the Germanic ‘galaubjan’ (to hold dear, esteem, trust) 
>
> RICHARD: [..] By its very nature a belief is not factually true ... otherwise it would not need to be believed to be true. A fact is obvious; it is out in the open.
