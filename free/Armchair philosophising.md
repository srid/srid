# Armchair philosophising/ psychologising 

• [Respondent]: ‘There is also confusion as to what should be done as soon as I find myself feeling less than [[Feeling good|good]]. Sometimes I read that I should get back to [[Feeling good|feeling good]] quickly before investigating the feeling, other times I read that I should track back and investigate first in order to feel good.

• [Richard]: ‘The latter advice relates to [[Aware-Cum-Attentive|consciously experiencing]] whatever it is which is preventing [[Felicity and Innocuity|happiness and harmlessness]] (less it all be but a ==detached/ disassociated intellectual exercise==) ... for example: [Richard]: ‘It is impossible for one to [[Native intelligence|intelligently]] observe what is going on within if one does not at the same time acknowledge the occurrence of one’s various feeling-tones with attentiveness. This is especially true with the hostile and invidious emotions and passions (those that are hateful and fearful). In order to observe one’s own fear, for instance, one must admit to the fact that one is afraid. Nor can one examine one’s own depression, for another example, without acknowledging it fully. The same is true for irritation and agitation and frustration and all those other uncomfortable emotional and passionate moods. One cannot examine something fully if one is busy denying its existence’
