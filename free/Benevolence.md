RICHARD: There is no line or divide (be it thin, arbitrary, artificial, or otherwise) between blind nature’s very essential survival package and the universe – biological-inheritance is not a miraculous gift bestowed by some inscrutable god/ goddess – as this actual world, the world of the [[Sensuousness|senses]], is indeed characterised by **benevolence and benignity** (there is neither cruelness nor horrors in actuality). However, in the real world, the world of the psyche, any such **kindly disposition** – as in being well-disposed, bountiful, liberal, bounteous, beneficent (aka **benevolent**) and being favourable, propitious, salutary (aka benign) – being not readily apparent, as in directly experienceable, requires [[Naivete|naiveté]] for its intellectual ascertainment.
