The **sex identity** (or **sexual identity**[^gay]) is the part of one's [[Social Identity]] representing the artificial edifice of feelings, beliefs, rules, virtues and narratives built on top of the biological "base" of libido. It produces [socially scripted behaviour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_script_theory) - wherein one is playing the role of a "Husband," a "Bachelor," or "Someone Looking for The One" and so on, acting out a script telling them _who_ to desire, _how_ to pursue them, and _what_ the relationship must look like to be considered "valid".

[^gay]: Which is nothing to do with 'sexual orientation'.

By becoming free of this sexual identity, sex largely becomes recreation (a pleasant bodily activity) rather than a "sacrament" (a source of worth). There is virtually no [[Hope|hope]], despair, expectations, disappointments, demands, sorrow, malice, jealousy, dreams, fantasies, boredom, inferiority/superiority ([[Self-worth|self-worth]] complex) and so on. Social scripts become null and void, for one's behaviour is [[Spontaneity|spontaneous]] ([[Naivete|guileless]]), as opposed to being pre-planned (with [[Wiliness of the wild|guile]]), guided by the pure intent of the [[PCE|PCE]].
