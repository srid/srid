# Sexual Identity

The **sexual identity** is the part of one's [[Social Identity]] representing the massive, artificial edifice of identity, rules, virtues and narratives built on top of the biological "base" of libido. It includes [socially scripted behaviour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_script_theory) - wherein one is playing the role of a "Husband," a "Bachelor," or "Someone Looking for The One" acting out a script telling them _who_ to desire, _how_ to pursue them, and _what_ the relationship must look like to be considered "valid".

By becoming free of this sexual identity, sex largely becomes recreation. There is virtually no hope, despair, expectations, disappointments, demands, sorrow, malice, dreams, fantasies, boredom, inferiority/superiority (self-worth complex) and so on. Social scripts becomes null and void, for one's behaviour is [[Spontaneity|spontaneous]] ([[Naivete|guileless]]) as opposed to being pre-planned (with [[Wiliness of the wild|guile]]).
