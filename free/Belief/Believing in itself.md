# "Believing in itself"

> [!QUOTE] AI summary
> Based on the text provided, the phrase **"the believer is the believed"** encapsulates the core dilemma of the human condition as described by Richard: the "self" (or identity) is not a separate entity that _possesses_ [[Belief|beliefs]]; rather, the "self" is composed entirely _of_ beliefs and the feelings that fuel them.
>
> Here is an elaboration on why one cannot simply drop beliefs while maintaining a self-identity, based on the provided correspondence.
> 
> ### **1. The Identity _Is_ the Belief**
> 
> Richard argues that the sense of [[Identity|"I"]] (the ego or soul) is not an actual, tangible entity but a construct arising from the act of believing itself.
> 
> - **No Separation:** You cannot separate the "believer" from the "belief." Richard states clearly, "You are not separate from that belief... That belief is you".
> - **Emotion-Backed Thought:** A belief is defined as an "emotion-backed thought" or "passionate imagination". Since the identity is inextricably linked to feelings (the principle that "'I' am 'my' feelings and 'my' feelings are 'me'"), ==the identity itself is essentially a calcified belief==.
> - **The Origin:** The "I" arises out of the very action of believing—emotionally imagining something to be real that is not actual.
>     
> 
> ### **2. The Paradox of "Dropping" Beliefs**
> 
> The text highlights a logical impossibility in trying to "drop" beliefs while the "self" remains intact. If the "self" tries to eliminate a belief, it is essentially the disease trying to cure itself.
> 
> - **The "Dropper" is the Obstacle:** Richard explains that "'I' cannot drop the belief that 'I' exist because 'I', the would-be 'dropper', am what is to be dropped".
> - **The Loop of Exposure:** Similarly, the "I" cannot truly expose a misconception, because the "I" is what needs to be exposed.
> - **Preservation of Identity:** As long as there is a "who" doing the exposing or dropping, the structure of the "believer" remains, merely shifting focus to a new belief or concept.
>     
> 
> ### **3. The Failure of Intellectual Realization**
> 
> Simply understanding intellectually that "the self is a belief" is insufficient because that understanding itself can become just another belief held by the identity.
> 
> - **Intellectual Masturbation:** Richard warns that unless emotions and passions (like anger, sorrow, or malice) have vanished entirely from one's life, knowing that the self is a belief is merely [[Armchair philosophising|"intellectual masturbation"]].
> - **Belief Replacement:** Replacing a negative belief (e.g., "I am a loser") with a positive cognition (e.g., "I am a winner") is futile because it replaces one belief with another, keeping the "believer" (the identity) alive and trapped in the same system.
> - **Vigilance vs. Freedom:** Trying to constantly "clarify" concepts or drop beliefs one by one requires laborious, eternal vigilance. In contrast, actual freedom involves the complete disappearance of the entity that necessitates such vigilance.
> 
> ### **4. The Solution: Dissolution, Not Modification**
> 
> Since the believer _is_ the believed, the only resolution offered in the text is the [[Altruistic self-immolation|complete cessation]] of the believer (the identity).
> 
> - **Vanishing Ability:** For Richard, the ability to believe—"believing in itself"—has vanished entirely. He cannot believe because the entity that performs the act of believing (the identity/affective faculty) has "self-immolated".
> - **Apperception:** The alternative to belief is [[Apperception|apperception]]—a state of pure awareness where the "I" is absent, allowing the universe to be experienced as it actually is: distinct, immediate, and factually true without the filter of emotional imagination

> RICHARD: Speaking personally, I cannot believe anything. The ability to [[Belief|believe]] – **believing in itself** – has vanished out of me. Which brings this discussion back to the believing activity of thought and feelings. You are asking, in effect: Is there some real ‘me’ to experience? Am ‘I’ real?
> 
> When one observes oneself in action, ‘I’ seem to be real – very real at times – but am ‘I’ actual? No? Then why do ‘I’ appear to be real? Is it the activity of believing? ==The action of believing is to emotionally imagine something to be real that is not actual.==

> RICHARD: Unfortunately it is not such a simple matter as merely exposing and dropping [[Belief|beliefs]] and misconceptions. I would suggest asking who is doing the exposing and dropping. I would enquire into just who is holding the beliefs and misconceptions concerning an on-going self. [[Identity|‘I’]] cannot drop the belief that ‘I’ exist because ‘I’, the would-be ‘dropper’, am what is to be dropped. Like-wise, ‘I’ the would-be ‘exposer’, am what is to be exposed. Only [[Apperception|apperceptive awareness]] will do the trick.
