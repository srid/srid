# "Believing in itself"

> [!cite/richard] [Richard’s Selected Correspondence On Beliefs and Psittacisms](https://actualfreedom.com.au/richard/selectedcorrespondence/sc-belief.htm)

> RICHARD: Speaking personally, I cannot believe anything. The ability to [[Belief|believe]] – **believing in itself** – has vanished out of me. Which brings this discussion back to the believing activity of thought and feelings. You are asking, in effect: Is there some real ‘me’ to experience? Am ‘I’ real?
> 
> When one observes oneself in action, ‘I’ seem to be real – very real at times – but am ‘I’ actual? No? Then why do ‘I’ appear to be real? Is it the activity of believing? ==The action of believing is to emotionally imagine something to be real that is not actual.==

> RICHARD: Unfortunately it is not such a simple matter as merely exposing and dropping [[Belief|beliefs]] and misconceptions. I would suggest asking who is doing the exposing and dropping. I would enquire into just who is holding the beliefs and misconceptions concerning an on-going self. [[Identity|‘I’]] cannot drop the belief that ‘I’ exist because ‘I’, the would-be ‘dropper’, am what is to be dropped. Like-wise, ‘I’ the would-be ‘exposer’, am what is to be exposed. Only [[Apperception|apperceptive awareness]] will do the trick.
