[Richard’s Correspondence with No. 111](http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/listafcorrespondence/listaf111.htm),

> RICHARD: [..] there has been many an occasion over the years where, in face-to-face conversation, many a person has felt **overwhelmingly sleepy** – complete with **compulsive yawning** and **irresistibly heavy eyelids** – despite being [[Curiosity-Fascination-Obsession|vitally interested]] and (up until then) participating keenly in what is being discussed.

> Upon enquiry replies have generally been to the effect that it all just gets ==too much to take in at one sitting/ all at once== (hence the autonomic shutdown).
