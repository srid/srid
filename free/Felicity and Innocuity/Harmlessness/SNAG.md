And by seeing it I wanted it to stop! It became yet another motivation to do all I could to eliminate my ‘self’. I wanted not only peace for myself, but for others too.’ Peter’s Journal – Peace

For the ending of anger – causing ripples – is the ending of ‘me’. I used the term ‘causing ripples’ in my journal deliberately for I was nearly always able to control my anger – and most other emotions – and, as such, have not indulged in fights or violent acts, let alone verbal arguments, competitive sports, etc. I was **a S.N.A.G., a wimp, a pacifist, a nice guy**. When I came across Richard and his journal it was the [[Harmlessness|harmless]] in ‘happy and harmless’ that was really appealing, for I knew that ==although I was a nice guy I could not honestly say I was harmless==. In all my relationships, I knew that was as much the cause of dis-harmony as the other.
