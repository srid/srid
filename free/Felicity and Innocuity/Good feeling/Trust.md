> [..] **Trust** is the ‘faith or conviction in the loyalty, strength, veracity, etc., of a person or thing; reliance on the truth of a statement etc., without examination’ ... and faith is ‘[[Belief|belief]], especially without evidence or proof’ 
> 
> Trust is but the antidote to doubt ... without doubt, where is the need for trust? And, as doubt arises out of [[Security|insecurity]], then your trust is based on – and fuelled by – uncertainty and lack of confidence in your [[Native intelligence|ability to discern and appraise]].

> To ‘trust’ someone – anyone at all – is to invite betrayal ... to ‘trust’ someone is to impose a demand upon them that they may not be able to live up to (or want to) and I never do that. I have had no use for ‘trust’ at all: to ‘trust’ is to attract deception. Etymologically, ‘trust’ – a covenant with ‘The Truth’ – is in the same category as faith – loyalty to ‘The Truth’ – and both are aligned with belief. [[Belief]] means fervently wishing to be true. There is not much difference between ‘trust’ and faith ... as a generalisation perhaps ‘trust’ is used more in [[Spirituality|spiritual]] circles, whereas faith is more aligned with the religious. ‘Trust’ seems to have more solid connotations than faith – to the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] aspirant, who scorns religion and all its trappings – yet, essentially they amount to the same. They all give rise to hope. [[Hope]]#, the antidote to despair, is what most people live on. Living in hope – having faith or trusting – is a poor substitute for the living purity of the perfection of the actual. Hope sets one up for [[Disappointment|disappointment]] time and again ... and all it is, is the antidote for despair. All trusting, believing, hoping and having faith and certitude are but the antidotes to distrust, disbelief, despair, doubt or suspicion.
