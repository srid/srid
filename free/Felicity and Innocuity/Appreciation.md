> Appreciation is the most potent aspect of the [[Actualism Method|actualism method]] because as I said before – it "is the very key to ***exponentially*** increase the level of your enjoyment, expand it in scope and depth" […] to the point of excellence being the norm. It is the key to upgrade your "hedonic adaptation set-point" ([link](https://.actualfreedom.com.au/various/well-equippedmarvelling.htm)) from feeling grumpy, to feeling neutral, to [[Feeling good|feeling good]] and to feeling excellent as the new set-point to fall back upon, so that even when ‘you’ come back from a [[PCE|PCE]] you no longer fall back to feeling neutral, but you ‘fall back’ to feeling excellent. Consistently appreciating [[living in the world as it is with people as they are|the world and people and events around you]] can and will enable you to reset your genetically/ [[Social Identity|socially]] inherited hedonic set-point.

> So, starting where you are at (always the best place to start from), you can become aware of the less obvious irregularities in your daily feeling of regularity/ the majority experience of being a regular person, such as feeling slightly better than before until you start to recognise and acknowledge each moment of feeling somewhat better; those moments provide a base for you to build upon until you can say to yourself (and anyone who may be listening) that you are feeling good. (Feeling good is a generic term for a general feeling of well-being).

> And this is where the fun begins: the aim is to enjoy and appreciate being alive each moment again; **when you are [[Feeling good|feeling good]] then enjoy and appreciate feeling good; such enjoyment and appreciation is the way in which you consolidate what you have established (feeling good) and sets up an automatic signalling device (a flashing red light as it were) to let you know of the slightest [[Diminishment|diminishment]] of feeling good;** as it is easier to remain feeling good than having to claw your way back out of feeling bad (a general feeling of ill-being) you have a vested interest in remaining attentive all the while you are feeling good.

> The more you feel good the more feeling good happens; the more feeling good happens the better you feel; the better you feel the more feeling better gets ... and so on and so on ... gradually increasing ever-incrementally until one day you can get to the stage the identity in residence all those years ago got to where ‘he’ would say how ‘he’ had to invent a new word (‘bester’) because how on earth could best keep on getting better.
