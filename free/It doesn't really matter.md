> RICHARD: \[..\] The [[Identity|'I']] that used to inhabit this body did everything possible that 'I' could do to blatantly imitate the actual in that 'I' endeavoured to be happy and [[Harmlessness|harmless]] for as much as is humanly possible. This was achieved by ==putting everything on a **'it doesn't really matter' basis**==. That is, 'I' would prefer people, things and events to be a particular way, but if it did not turn out like that ... it did not really matter for it was only a preference. 'I' chose to no longer give other people – or the weather – the power to make 'me' angry ... or irritated ... or even peeved, if that was possible. It was great fun and very, very rewarding along the way. 'My' life became cleaner and clearer and more and more pure as each habitual way of living life was consciously eliminated through constant exposure. Finally 'I' invited the actual by [[Out from control|letting go of the controls]] and letting this moment live 'me'. 'I' [[Being the doing of what is happening|became the experience of the doing of this business of being alive]] ... no longer the 'do-er'. Thus 'my' days were numbered ... 'I' could hardly maintain 'myself' ... soon 'my' time would come to an end. An inevitability set in and a thrilling momentum took over ... 'my' demise became imminent.

> The moment of the [[Death|death]] of 'me' was so real that it was experienced as being that one was going into the grave physically ... that is how real 'I' am.

> RICHARD: It is the very fact of physical [[Death|death]] – everybody alive today on this planet will eventually be dead – which ensures happiness and harmlessness ... if everything alive today were to all-of-a-sudden endure forever then everything would matter in the long-term (everything would be of enduring importance (in this ultimate sense) and, therefore, life would be a [[Seriousness|serious]] business.

> RICHARD: It is all part and parcel of the process whereby this universe can experience itself as a sensate and reflective human being: as such the universe can know itself apperceptively. What one does is acquiesce to life by embracing [[Death|death]] ... one wholeheartedly dedicates oneself to being here as the universe's experience of itself right now: it is the unreserved !YES! to being alive as this flesh and blood body.

> RICHARD: The absolutely undeniable fact of physical [[Death|death]] means that, in an ultimate sense, nothing really matters: as nothing lasts forever (matter arranges and rearranges itself endlessly totally wiping out whatever came before) there is nothing worth dying for. Hence playfulness ... I could not be solemn if my life depended upon it.
