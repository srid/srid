> Richard: **Sensuousness** is the wondrous awareness of the marvel of [[Being here now|being here now]] at [[This Moment|this moment]] in time and this place in space – which awareness is combined with the [[Curiosity-Fascination-Obsession|fascination]] of [[Pure Contemplation|contemplating]] that this moment is one’s only moment of being alive – and one is [[Never not this moment|never alive at any other time]] than now. And, wherever one is ... now ... one is always here ... now ... even if one starts walking over to ‘there’ ... now ... along the way to ‘there’ ... now ... one is always here ... now ... and when one arrives ‘there’ ... now ... it too is here ... now.

> Thus awareness is an [[Curiosity-Fascination-Obsession|attraction]] to the fact that one is always here – and it is already now – and as one is already here and it is always now then one has arrived before one starts. Such delicious wonder fosters the innate condition of [[Naivete|naiveté]] (which is the closest ‘I’ can get to innocence) the nourishing of which is essential if the charm of it all is to occur. The potent combination of awareness – fascinated reflective contemplation – and **sensuousness** produces [[Apperception|apperception]], which happens when the mind becomes aware of itself (‘I’ disappear).

> RICHARD: The other aspect of the [[Actualism Method|actualism method]] – other than [[Felicity and Innocuity|felicity/ innocuity]] – is **sensuosity**: ==feeling felicitous/ innocuous, each moment again, brings one closer to one’s senses== and the resultant [[Curiosity-Fascination-Obsession|wonder]] at the brilliance of the sensate world can enable [[Apperception|apperception]] ... the direct experience of the world as-it-is.
