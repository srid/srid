From Richardâ€™s [Selected Correspondence](http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/selectedcorrespondence/sc-method.htm) On How To Become Free of the Human Condition,

[Richard]: â€˜It takes some doing to start off with, but as success after success starts to multiply exponentially, it becomes automatic to have [[How am I experiencing this moment of being alive|this question]] running as an on-going thing (as a ==ðŸ™Šnon-verbal attitude== towards life; a ==ðŸ”‡wordless approach== each moment again) because it delivers the goods right here and now ... not off into some indeterminate futureâ€™

[Richard]: [..] the words â€˜==ðŸ™Šnon-verbal attitude==â€™, and â€˜==ðŸ”‡wordless approach==â€™, are indicative of that awareness of those instinctual impulses/ affective feelings â€“ and thus self-centred thought â€“ being an **affective awareness**.

---

[Richard]: Please note: once it becomes second-nature â€“ a ==ðŸ™Šnon-verbal attitude== to life; a ==ðŸ”‡wordless approach== to living â€“ an intuitive awareness, as in an affective monitoring of mood and temperament, dispenses with that initial [[Diligence and perseverance]].
