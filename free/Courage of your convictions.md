At times this audacity[^a] – that it will be me who does it – approaches megalomania[^m] ... after all, one thinks, who am I to think that I can break through the impasse that has baffled humankind for millennia? As long as one does not succumb to delusions of grandeur, a healthy dose of what appears to be megalomania[^m] is appropriate ... otherwise one is held back by [[Cynical non-pioneers|the mediocrity of those]] who say you can not do it. You can. The only requirement is that one be a human being – and that I hereby devote my entire life to breaking through to the perfection and peace that is lying open all around right now ... if only I had the eyes to see it. It takes great courage and fortitude to fly in the face of all those ‘would be’s’ and ‘want to be’s’ who, alas, only talk about it. One has to do it ... because, after all is said and done, it is my life that I am living.
