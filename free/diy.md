> RESPONDENT: ... \[Here’s the answer to your stalled actualist efforts\] – you need to buddy up.

> RICHARD: No, **there is no ‘need’ whatsoever to buddy up (aka chum up)** ... the code has been cracked, once and for all, and the way now lies wide open, and wondrously so, for anybody and everybody **irregardless of their marital status**.

> RESPONDENT: Just one more thing, have you thought about doing some sort of (paid) instruction on the basics of AF? I know it is all on the site, but that can be a bit intimidating for new people. Anyway, just an idea.

> VINEETO: No, there won’t be any paid instructions, as this would defeat the purpose of becoming free from the human condition in toto, **by yourself, [[Your own best friend|for yourself]]**. An actual freedom can by its very nature **never be a group process**.

As you have probably read in Peter’s Journal, this is exactly why Peter ventured out to find a suitable woman – but **if you don’t find one or are not inclined to then actualism works just as well when on your own**.
