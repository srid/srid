[^un]: See [Dead by Daylight is a KILLER SIDED game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAdFsK4hwl0)

[^de]: For example, stealth used to be a viable strategy, but not anymore; see this [opinion of someone](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/1lea4gt/if_the_afk_system_isnt_reverted_i_may_not_return/) from Southeast Asia (whose players apparently utilize the stealth strategy a lot).
