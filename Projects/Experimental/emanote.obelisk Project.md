`emanote.obelisk` gives life to your plain-text notes. Like [[Neuron]], it supports Markdown, wiki-links and folgezettel (see #[[Zettelkasten]]). Unlike neuron, emanote's website is fully dynamic (it uses #[[Obelisk]] underneath), thus has the potential for doing many interesting things that neuron's statically generated cannot easily.

Like [[ka Project]], architecture work done on emanote may carry over to neuron (see [[Hybrid rewrite-refactor]]).

You can access its source code [here](https://github.com/srid/emanote.obelisk).
