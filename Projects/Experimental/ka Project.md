`ka` (originally announced in [[Neuron 1.0 released]]) was a research playground (and an instance of [[Hybrid rewrite-refactor]] model of project develoment) for #[[Zettelkasten]], as well as an independent app, for [[Neuron]]. Like Neuron, it is written in #[[Haskell]], but built on top of #[[Reflex-FRP]]. See [ka.srid.ca](https://ka.srid.ca/) for details.
