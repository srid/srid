The quality of a social network tends to decline as it grows to encompass a larger portion of the general public. This is because the network starts to reflect the "median" of the human condition, which is typically of average quality. The median represents the [[unfree|orthodox]], mundane, and conventional aspects of society.

In contrast, progress occurs among the [outliers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGDbpg1nG8Y). Humanity could not have been progressing towards betterment without the at-that-point-in-time fringe-heterodox thinking normally associated with creativity.

This explains why social media was captivating in its early years but has become increasingly restrictive and of average quality over time, largely due to [[censorship|censorship]].

The core problem here is the _monolithic_ nature of these social networks, not their size per se. The solution is [decentralization][vitalik],[^uk] making it impossible for there to be a large monolithic network thus discouraging any form of _universal_ group-think, for there will be no such universal group.

It is time we humans (i.e., each of us individuals) let go of the idea of "humanity" (i.e., as a "group"); decentralized social networks today have a fantastic opportunity to play their technological role in it.

[^uk]: Until we get there federation might be an acceptable compromise, as the UK House of Lords [recommended](https://reclaimthenet.org/uk-house-of-lords-blasts-big-tech-as-monopolizers-of-the-public-square-in-new-report/) in [its report](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld5802/ldselect/ldcomuni/54/5408.htm#_idTextAnchor118)
    > Social media services offer citizens unparalleled opportunities to share their opinions with others. However, this market is dominated by a small number of very powerful companies. Rather than allowing these platforms to monopolise the digital public square, there should be **a range of interlinked services between which users can freely choose and move**. The Digital Markets Unit should make structural interventions to increase competition, including **mandating interoperability**.

    It is worth keeping in mind, however, that when it comes to [[Mastodon]] (federated alternative to [[Twitter]]) - federation blocklists adopted by instance admins -- and enforced *unilaterally* on their users -- beats the spirit of it all, because many popular instances that adopt [IdPol-fested](https://archive.is/gqzcn) policies end up clustering, and [blocking](https://archive.is/eoNcR) other (non-IdPol adopting) instances en masse. See [jointhefedi.com](https://jointhefedi.com/) for a list of servers. The problem here is that moderation and censorship is still done by centralized parties (ie. instance admins) rather than [voluntarily by the individual people](https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors) themselves. Any centralized and unilateral enforcing of speech online is [likely to become corrupt no matter the intention](https://reclaimthenet.org/former-aclu-head-ira-glasser-explains-why-you-cant-ban-hate-speech/). [[Mastodon]] instances are also more likely to suffer from [activist pressure](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34748195) than Twitter.

[^mod]: More on moderation [here](https://forum.cardano.org/t/censorship-on-social-media-how-blockchain-could-be-the-new-norm-for-unfiltered-communications/41855),
    >  Online communities that are totally unmoderated can often turn into places that the majority of web users will not want to visit, and it is not always possible to have a totally free online platform without some users feeling marginalized or targeted.
    >
    > This prompts some incredibly difficult ethical questions. Some could argue that should content on a particular social media site become offensive or derogatory to an individual or group of people, they of course have the option not to participate or create their own inclusive online community.
    >
    > Others would lobby for the removal of more problematic online communities and censorship of controversial individuals completely, arguing that they pose a risk of causing harm, and looking to platform owners to remove associated accounts and content on users’ behalf—in other words, to engage in active censorship. This can in turn lead to over-zealous moderation within online communities.
    >
    > Through [[Blockchain|blockchain]], there could be a better solution—a distributed and community-led moderation process which relies not on censorship from a centralized custodian wielding absolute power, but careful moderation via a democratic process empowered by each and every user through decentralized technology. In this way, the entire social media ecosystem could decide the direction of their community and empower good actors to participate.
    > 
    > In theory, such decentralized social media platforms could place power back into the hands of the users, by allowing them to set the direction and rules of their own online communities, and decide what kind of content they publish and read according to community-chosen preferences, rather than that approved by centralized authorities.
