By chance I discovered a middle-ground between *completely rewriting a software program* and *laboriously making incremental changes to little effect*. 

The third alternative is to start an entirely a new project implementing the ideas/improvements in mind ...  without the encumbrances of the old project's architecture. At the end of this time-boxed period of fresh development, there is often a more straightforward opportunity to take those learnings and apply it to the old project, improving its architecture in the process.
