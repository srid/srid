The human psyche is a bundle of emotions & beliefs forming one's [[Identity]] (which includes [[Social Identity]]).

Various affective perceptions of the world are components of this identity:

- The "I" or "me" one thinks and feels oneself to be
- Any "group" one *belongs* to
	- Including the largest group, "humanity"

These entities ("I", "me", "group", "humanity") are nothing more than *psychic apparitions*, as distinct from the *flesh & blood* human bodies they supposedly represent. They are the ultimate cause of all human suffering ([[malice]] and [[sorrow]]).

The death of the psyche entails [[Altruistic self-immolation]]#.
