The essense of *systems thinking*: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSRP

## Root crisis

> [[climate-alarmism|Climate change]], hunger, wealth distribution, and chlidhood obesity, while all legitimate crises, are not the *root* crisis. The root crisis is the way we think. That is the problem that underlies all the other problems. We must change our thinking from binary, linear, and categorical kind to a new form of thinking called systems thinking to solve the issues facing humanity. ---Systems Thinking Made Simple, by Cabrera

The ultimate "root crisis" of course is the human condition itself (see [[free]]).
