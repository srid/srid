Most [mood trackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_tracking) use a predetermined list of absolute mood values; eg.: very bad, bad, neutral, good, very good. I think absolute values are not fitting of describing moods. Let's use *binary* values instead.

## Registering moods

In particular, the system will ask the question:

> If an higher power were to grant you the wish that your present mood will be made permanent for the rest of your life, would you take it?

There are two possible answers to it: *Yes* and *No*. If you answered "yes", you are [[Feeling good|feeling good]], otherwise it is obvious that the current mood needs to be bettered. Whether you are feeling meh/neutral[^stoic] *or* depressed, the answer would be "No".

[^stoic]: Unless, of course, one is so inculcated with stoic values as to accept a neutral mood for the rest of one's life.

### Registering of "how" and "why"

As we periodically register these binary values in a system, one can't help but [[Aware-Cum-Attentive|take note of]] their background context as well---this includes, more generally, the "why" and "how" of the mood's existance as well as [labelling of any affect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_labeling) involved. I don't see any need (yet) to formally record these on paper because our memory is a good enough place to do this.

## Reflection after-the-fact

[ ] Once we record these mood data, what do we do with this? How can the context prompts (of "how" and "why"), which are being more etched into working memory (thanks to the system prompts), be used to [[Felicity and Innocuity|change]] one's mood baseline?
