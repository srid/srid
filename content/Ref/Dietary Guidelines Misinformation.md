The "Dietary Guidelines for Americans" (which many other countries inculclate uncritically) is a stellar example of actual [[misinformation]] sanctioned at government level. See [The Science Behind the Dietary Guidelines: Is It Sound?](https://www.nutritioncoalition.us/science-not-settled) for details.

  - "Our analysis found that 95% of the committee members had COI with the food, and/or pharmaceutical industries" -- [Conflicts of interest for members of the U.S. 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/conflicts-of-interest-for-members-of-the-us-2020-dietary-guidelines-advisory-committee/843992D8901540296BCEB43D716C1497)
- Canada
  - "Health Canada promised that its new food guide would be developed based on scientific merit, transparently and with decisions made at arm’s length from industry.  A more [[Vegan Propaganda|plant-based]], less highly processed dietary approach is being advised that takes into account [[climate-alarmism|environmental concerns]]." -- [Resisting influence from agri-food industries on Canada’s new food guide](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5903885/)
  - "we are not aware of a single study that has compared a whole-food, plant-based diet with a whole-food, animal protein–based diet. Without these data controlling for food quality, it would be premature to advise Canadians to [[Vegan Propaganda|choose plants]] over meat." -- [Canada Food Guide’s focus on reducing saturated fat contradicts evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6148650/)
