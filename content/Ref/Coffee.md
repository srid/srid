# Coffee ‚òïÔ∏è

A good tasting coffee makes all the difference.

## Essential equipment

Invest in these:

- Scale (0.1g precision)
- Brew kettle with precision thermometer (I use Fellow Stagg)
- Coffee canister (I use Airscape)
- A good burr grinder (I use Niche Zero, or Comandante when travelling)
- Grinder brush
- Aeropress

## Dialing

When coffee tastes bad, change one or more of these factors. It may take several attempts to get it right.

- Grind size 
  - Get a good burr grinder![^h]
- Water temperature 
  - higher for light roasts; lower for dark roasts
  - even a +/- 5f adjustment can make a difference
- Coffee to water ratio
  - I generally do not vary this, and keep it fixed at 10:100g.
- Change to a new coffee matching your preferred flavour in the [flavour wheel](https://atlanticspecialtycoffee.com/wp-content/uploads/SCA_TasterWheel_English_8.5x11.pdf)[^myf]

Generally speaking, you mainly want to vary grind size and/or water temperature.

[^myf]: I enjoy flavours towards chocolate/sugar side of the spectrum, which tends to come from medium to dark roasted coffee from certain regions (like Brazil Santos).

[^h]: If getting a manual hand grinder, note the the way of grinding [may matter](https://old.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/lkazl5/hand_grinder_use_ive_been_doing_it_all_wrong/).

## Brew methods

How I typically make coffee:

### Inverted Aeropress recipe

- Invert the Aeropress
- Add 10g[^a7] of coffee (grind about 10.1g, to account for grinder retention)
- Water temp at 175f-194f (depending on beans)
- Start timer; pour about 40g; and stir until ~25 seconds
- Pour rest, total 100g.
- Brew until 1m 25s
- Press for ~30seconds (don't push; use gravity from arms)
- Add ~35g of hot water to brewed coffee.

If you use fresh coffee with your preferred flavour profile, and select the right grind size and water temperature for those beans - expect this method to consistently produce a great cup of ~125g of rich coffee (from 10g beans) that is equivalent in strength to what the [Qu√©b√©cois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois_people) call [caf√© allong√©](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lungo).

[^a7]: 10g appears to be the minimum required to make a good cup. 7g did not work out well for me.

### Kalita Wave 155 recipe

TODO: This recipe is usually not successful (probably because I tend to use espresso blends?).

- 10g of coffee
- 185-194f water temp (depends on beans)
- 35g pour, wait 35 secs.
- Pour rest, total 135g. Wait till water comes through.

### Cafe Smith

A local cafe chain I have been trying.

- [1653 Espresso Blend](https://en.smithcafe.com/collections/cafes-selection-la-maison-smith/products/1653-melange-espresso)
  - 185f; 14c
  - Sumptuous! Great aftertaste.

## Learnings / experimentation

- [x] More coffee doesn't impact sleep when fasting during the day (ie. OMAD close to bed time)
- [x] Eating (creamy) butter in between cups helps 'reset' taste receptor.
    - [x] Though eating a meal is ideal.
- [ ] Roast coffee myself
