# Wokeism

**Wokeism** (under which [neoracism](https://johnmcwhorter.substack.com/p/the-elect-neoracists-posing-as-antiracists) belongs) is a secular religion that originated in the United States of America, presumably around 2016 (see [[woke-invasion]]). It is closely accompanied by the pseudoscienfic field [[crt]]. The central thesis of the religion is best characterized by the following passage:

> Speaking of ‘*the illusion of change by activism*’: what I have noticed, whilst pottering around the world-wide-web, is that those of a sinistral statist ideology (such as your ‘*marxism/ postmodernism/ feminism*’ wording is suggestive of) are apparently [[woke-psychology|extracting meaning and/or purpose]]# from busying themselves in the redressment of systemic cultural ‘wrongs’, via the heavy hand of state compulsion[^govt], through retaining [[censorship|tight control of ‘the public narrative]]’ – having long-ago seized the high moral ground of [[unwoke|minority-group]]# injustice (as per your ‘*fighting for the rights of the vulnerable classes*’ words) – on a yet-to-be-demonstrated premiss that an equitable society can be legislated into existence (i.e., imposed on all citizens at the point of state-owned/ state-controlled guns), in a ‘majority-rules’ society, on a ‘minorities-rule’ basis.  ---[ref](http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/listdcorrespondence/listd38.htm)

    > [...] A simpler thesis would be that the reason so much of “Big Tech” spontaneously coordinated [to [[censorship|censor]]] as it did was a **political calculus** aimed at avoiding onerous regulation by currying favour with the incoming administration.

    > [...] For years, Zuckerberg has begged Congress to craft a set of rules for him to follow concerning online speech. Among tech executives, he is not alone in his **discomfort** with shouldering responsibilities that seem to border on governance
