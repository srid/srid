A modern philosophical movement that had its origins in the likes of Mr. Eliezer Yudkowsky (of the 'LessWrong' fame), known for its members' rather excursive[^ex] style of writings resulting from hyperfocus on cognition and blindness to [[free|affect]].

Being artful (cf. [[Naivete|naiveté]]) often takes the form of [[Armchair philosophising|armchair]] sophistry[^sop] ("gish gallop" for instance) in rationalists. Like anyone with an [[Genetic Identity|identity]], [[Native intelligence|native intelligence]] does not always operate and function cleanly and clearly on the movement's members, despite well-meaning efforts and intentions.

## People skeptical of rationalists

- [Alexandros Marinos](https://twitter.com/search?q=rationalists%20from%3AalexandrosM&src=typed_query) -- who is also known to have gotten into [argument with](https://nitter.net/alexandrosM/status/1533327207795335168) Mr. Scott Alexander (yet another 'authority' in this movement, commanding its denizens [what to think](https://doyourownresearch.substack.com/p/scott-alexandriad-iii-driving-up?s=r)). 

[^ex]: Ctrl+F `excursive` in [this page](http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/listdcorrespondence/listdclaudiu2.htm) for examples.

[^sop]: See [this tweet](https://twitter.com/karlprosser/status/1479528095426113538) for one way of expressing this sophistry:

    > [..] “sophisticated” thinkers often have just build layers of thought/words/rationalizations on top of the same emotions as everybody else.
    > 
    > [..] emotion driven arguments can be articulately woven with the form and vocabulary of rational norms
