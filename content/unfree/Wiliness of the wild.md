slug: wily

The expression 'wiliness of the wild' (a direct opposite of [[Naivete]]) refers to the cunningness inherent to human species (arising from the genetically-inherited instinctual passions) in particular, as well as the animal species[^foxy] in general. The word 'wily' has the following as its synonyms:

[^foxy]: As indicated by the word '[foxy](https://www.lexico.com/definition/foxy)' for instance.

-  crafty, cunning, artful, sly, scheming, calculating, guileful, disingenuous, devious, Machiavellian; deceitful, deceptive, Janus-faced, dishonest, cheating, double-dealing

> RICHARD: Wherever there be no underestimating the extent to which a lost, lonely, frightened and **very, very cunning** [[Identity|feeling-being]] will go in order to remain affectively-psychically in existence – millions upon millions of years of blind nature’s successful perpetuation of the species via its rough-and-ready instinctual survival passions blindly dictates no other course of action can ever instinctually come about – is where there be far less likelihood of ascribing to nescience that which quite properly has its roots in the ==visceral **wiliness of the wild**== which has so successfully proliferated the species thus far.

> It is no-one’s fault if they be **more cunning** – **more instinctively wily** – than the norm as it is genetic inheritance which determines the degree to which instinctual drives, urges, impulses, appetites, and all the rest, are operating. --[Richard’s Selected Correspondence On Naiveté](http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/selectedcorrespondence/sc-naivete.htm)

## Wiliness as explicitly taught

In modern Occidental cultures, the following authors have led their audience into consciously enhancing their genetically inherited wiliness-of-the-wild so as to take advantage of the [[Gullibility|gullible]] others:

- [The 48 Laws of Power by **Robert Greene**](https://www.nateliason.com/notes/48-laws-power-robert-greene)
- [How to Win Friends and Influence People by **Dale Carnegie**](https://fs.blog/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people/)

Note: Although Mr. Greene here is more likely to receive moral opprobrium than Mr. Carnegie, both of their teachings ought to be viewed in a morally neutral way (see the 'no-one's fault' above) so as to allow the discovery of the wiliness inherent to the teachings.
