Wikipedia is [[Wikipedia is not neutral|not trust worthy]] in controversial topics. Here's a trick I use to extract heterodox views on topics which are otherwise #[[censorship|censored]] in Wikipedia.

1.  Visit the wikipedia article for any controversial article
2.  Click 'View history'
3.  Look for large reverts in bold red (which are not obvious vandalism)
4.  See what got removed

## Examples

For example, the topic of *sexual objectification* is not exactly uncontroversial. And heterodox views are periodically censored out of its Wikipedia article by power users (senior and [[woke-invasion|woke]] editors). The [removal of views by Christina Hoff Sommers and Naomi Wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sexual_objectification&diff=1020578292&oldid=1020577791) on the subject is a good example. If you were just reading the latest version of the Wikipedia article, you would only get the censored version - but if you perused the page history and unearthed these deleted passages, you get to see a more comprehensive (i.e., umm ... encyclopedic) view on it.

[Here's another example](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sexual_objectification&diff=1020575648&oldid=1019253515) (one that I find more interesting) from the same article acting as an illustration of what I call 'soft censorship'. Here, the editor censored out a bunch of entries from the 'See also' section, presumably because it goes contrary to the doctrine of objectification.

Finally, even neural seeming articles are "cleaned up" by politically motivated editors. [An ealier version](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Schadenfreude&oldid=1025877365) of the *Schadenfreude* article had a statement in the lead saying *"adults also experience schadenfreude, although generally they conceal it"* which got removed (an act of 'soft censorship') to the point that the article [now reads](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Schadenfreude&oldid=1087233110) --- to present a more [[woke|woke]]-approved version of the emotion --- *"Schadenfreude [..] may be an important social emotion establishing "inequity aversion"."*.
