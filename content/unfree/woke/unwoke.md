# Undoing Woke Invasion

The first step to resist or undo [[woke-invasion]] in your organization (or your psyche) is to thoroughly understand their creed [[crt]], so as to uncover the fact that generally speaking woke disciples care [[Luxury beliefs|less]] about the problems in the world than assuaging their self-centered ideological feelings.[^mhg] The next step, obviously, is then to effectuate an elimination of the wannabe woke invaders from your organization by instituting a culture based on common sense values stripped of identity politics.

[^mhg]: It is vital to realize that the woke really have no moral high ground. They are as corrupt ([[woke-psychology|psychologically speaking]]) as the groups they criticize.

## Case studies

### Organizations

A sample of tech companies successfully extricating themselves out of [[woke-invasion]] is presented below. What level of diplomacy you choose in your tactic is up to you; Brian Armstrong (Coinbase) and DHH (Basecamp) were demonstrably more diplomatic than Jesse Powell (Kraken).

### Individuals

If there is once case study I have to pick as my favourite, it would have to be Grace.

- **Grace**: a report of how she resisted [[woke-invasion]] in her non-profit organization in around year 2010, through clearly understanding [[crt]].
