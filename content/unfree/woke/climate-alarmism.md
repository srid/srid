# Climate Alarmism

"Climate change" alarmism (aka. climate apocalyptic fantasy) is the current iteration of the [long line](https://nypost.com/2021/11/12/50-years-of-predictions-that-the-climate-apocalypse-is-nigh/) of religiously
catastrophistic thinking[^doom] humanity has been harbouring for generations, which alarmism has its origins in [[Identity|identity]] itself inasmuch as fear itself is sourced in it.

> Green catastrophism has its roots in thousands of years of religious doom-mongering.

## Hypocrisy

From http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/listdcorrespondence/listd45.htm

>RESPONDENT: I feel very much like a white-collar peasant. Engaged in the rat-race to get to the top and realise there is nothing there ala what John Lennon and your friend spoke about.
>
>RICHARD: What is there at the top is, of course, money/ assets, fame/ prestige and, especially, power – albeit a puny power, being over people (to have them do as bid), and not a potent power, as over the physical world (to directly effect beneficial material modification) – but there is ‘nothing there’ of intrinsic value (as in, nothing of significance, in the ‘meaning of life’ significance, that is).
>
>RESPONDENT: I can relate to the Stockholm Syndrome aspect quite well too.
>
>RICHARD: Good ... capture-bonding (i.e., loyalty to ‘the system’ in this context), when unexamined, enables the continuance of complicity (as already mentioned further above) with its especially insidious loyalty
>
>RESPONDENT: [..] The question I have for you is: Can you elaborate some more on becoming aware of this [[Peasant Mentality|peasant mentality]] - specifically as it relates to practising actualism?
>
>RICHARD: Essentially, seeing-through the whole sick-and-sorry system and, thus, ceasing to believe in it, is all what is required. [..]
>
> RESPONDENT: For instance would you recommend pragmatically minimising ones involvement in this system as a necessary (or helpful) condition to becoming actually free? Thanks.
>
>RICHARD: Not necessarily, no ... actualism practice works best in the market-place.
>
>Both [[Identity|feeling-being]] ‘Vineeto’ and feeling-being ‘Peter’ minimised their respective income-streams, within a year or so, but that was more because they valued their time over money than any other reason.
>
>Plus the more one [[Felicity and Innocuity|enjoys and appreciates]] being alive simply by [[Being here now|being here]], each moment again for as much as is humanly possible (editor: See [[Actualism Method]]), the lower the cost-of-living becomes as less and less discretionary spending is used-up in purchased entertainment, in socialising expenditure (e.g., fashion-house attire, designer-driven accoutrements, status-displaying automobiles, and etcetera), in mood-enhancement payments, in novelty-seeking travel costs, and so on and so forth.

>Golly, come to think of it, [[free|actualism]] should accrue quite a few brownie points for being so ... um ... so **environmentally-friendly**!

>Regards,

[^doom]: Which in turn is a special case of the more general phenomenon called 'doomsday syndrome', [viz](http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/selectedcorrespondence/sc-happy2.htm).

    > \[Richard\]: ‘Have you ever noticed that many an otherwise [[Native intelligence|intelligent]] person has been afflicted by the doomsday syndrome all throughout human history?  
    > If so, the words ‘all throughout human history’ should speak for themselves \[in regards the end of the world being nigh\].  
    > The doom being felt – and projected onto the world at large – is, of course, [[Identity|‘my’]] own doom: there is no way out, ‘I’ am doomed. ‘I’ must, inevitably, cease to ‘be’. Instead of bemoaning ‘my’ fate and vainly searching for an escape, ‘I’ can see ‘myself’ for what ‘I’ am. This seeing is the beginning of the ending of ‘me’. The extinction of ‘me’ is the ultimate sacrifice ‘I’ can make to ensure the possibility of [[free|peace-on-earth]] for not only this body but all bodies.
