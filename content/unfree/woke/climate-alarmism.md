# Climate Alarmism

"Climate change" alarmism (aka. climate apocalyptic fantasy) is the current iteration of the [long line](https://nypost.com/2021/11/12/50-years-of-predictions-that-the-climate-apocalypse-is-nigh/) of religiously
catastrophistic thinking[^doom] humanity has been harbouring for generations, which alarmism has its origins in [[Identity|identity]] itself inasmuch as fear itself is sourced in it.

> Green catastrophism has its roots in thousands of years of religious doom-mongering.

[^doom]: Which in turn is a special case of the more general phenomenon called 'doomsday syndrome', [viz](http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/selectedcorrespondence/sc-happy2.htm).

    > \[Richard\]: ‘Have you ever noticed that many an otherwise [[Native intelligence|intelligent]] person has been afflicted by the doomsday syndrome all throughout human history?  
    > If so, the words ‘all throughout human history’ should speak for themselves \[in regards the end of the world being nigh\].  
    > The doom being felt – and projected onto the world at large – is, of course, [[Identity|‘my’]] own doom: there is no way out, ‘I’ am doomed. ‘I’ must, inevitably, cease to ‘be’. Instead of bemoaning ‘my’ fate and vainly searching for an escape, ‘I’ can see ‘myself’ for what ‘I’ am. This seeing is the beginning of the ending of ‘me’. The extinction of ‘me’ is the ultimate sacrifice ‘I’ can make to ensure the possibility of [[free|peace-on-earth]] for not only this body but all bodies.
