# Woke Inveigling

> **inveigle**: persuade (someone) to do something by means of deception or flattery

- Linguistic:
  - [Woke Religion: A Taxonomy](https://boghossian.substack.com/p/woke-religion-a-taxonomy)
  - [Kafkatrapping, by esr](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=2122)
    - *The aim of the kafkatrap is to produce a kind of free-floating guilt in the subject, a conviction of sinfulness that can be manipulated by the operator to make the subject say and do things that are convenient to the operatorâ€™s personal, political, or religious goals. Ideally, the subject will then [internalize] these demands, and then become complicit in the kafkatrapping of others.*
- Social
  - cf. Cathy O'Neil's "The Shame Machine" arguing for replacing Cancel Culture with a shame-based inveigling of others into being propagandized with little to no resistance; i.e, via a [[Wiliness of the wild|consciously devised]] social influence mechanism (aka. psychological manipulation).
