# :notebook: Zettelkasten

Zettelkasten is a smart note taking system created by a German sociologist, whose productivity increased to epic proportions due to it[^dclear]. 

All notes in a Zettelkasten are linear, [atomic and autonomous](https://neuron.zettel.page/atomic), with links created between them, enabling a [heterarchy](https://neuron.zettel.page/heterarchy) to evolve organically, rather than having to preconceive a hierarchy ahead (as is the case with outliners like Workflowy and Dynalist).
