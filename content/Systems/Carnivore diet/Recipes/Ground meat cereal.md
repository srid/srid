# Ground meat "cereal"

A "[[Carnivore diet|carnivore]] cereal" made from duck fat, ground meat and salt.

## Preparation

I buy my **ground lamb** straight from local farms, who deliver it vaccum-packaged as packages of a pound each. Thaw them overnight ... and when ready to cook take it out of fridge and, while still in the vaccum bag, use a flat surface (such as a wooden cutting board) to press on the packet to flatten the meat out to resemble the texture and thickness of a burger. The result is a square-shaped larger burger patty which is well-suited for our hybrid stir-fry (ie. with browning).

## Cook

*This one's overcooked a bit; you should **not** see black parts.* Also, we use a non-stick pan here, which is [[Non-stick pan slow cooks meat|inferior to]] stainless steel pans.

Heat a stainless steel pan for 10 minutes at medium or medium high, put **duck fat** and then fry the patty for a few minutes each side. Careful not to overfry it (the color should be brown, but not black like near the edges in the picture). Once both sides have browned use a spatula to break down the meat and segue into **stir-frying** it. With the meat mostly cooked, add salt and continue stir-frying until thoroughly cooked (should be pink to brown, not red).

## Extras

I like to add Atlantic **shrimps** (precooked) at the end to give a more interesting biting texture. Spices and a **fried egg** on top, if you tolerate them, will perfect the taste profile (albeit at the expense of masking the meat's flavour).
