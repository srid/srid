# Clew

:::{.page-note}
These are just some rough notes on my attempts to deliberately induce a [[PCE|PCE]].
:::

> Incidentally, just before/ just as the [[PCE|PCE]] starts to wear off, if one unravels (metaphorically) ==a ‘golden thread’ or ‘clew’==, as one is slipping back into the real-world, *an intimate connection is thus established betwixt the pristine-purity of an actual innocence and the near-purity of the [[Sincerity|sincerity]] of [[Naivete|naiveté]]*.

While contemplating [[Never not this moment]][^same] ...
- Can immediately taste the "arriving here" of [[pce-reports]] (aka. [[Stillness of time|stillness]])
    - Music is raw; visual ambiance is getting to be brilliant ... all the while happening more in the *now-still* "arena"
      - The concomitant stillness is very palpable; revealed via the cessation of hitherto-existant "movement"
      - <small>It is the "moving" (in time) [[Identity]] that obscures it all otherwise.</small>
- Ergo, [[Stillness of time|stillness]], as I experienced in a PCE, **is a clew**.
- The clew (or the end of it that is close to the PCE) is accessed by seeing (via [[Pure Contemplation|contemplation]] and [[Curiosity-Fascination-Obsession|curiosity]]) if [[This Moment|this moment]] _is the same_[^same] (over time), with only events on it changing (over time).
    - Otherwise, that which appears to be changing "behind" is the [[Identity]]
    - Realizing (successfully 'seeing') it not to be changing ▶️ identity going into abeyance

- The [[Never not this moment]] contemplation to have apperception happen is intimately tied to asking [[How am I experiencing this moment of being alive]].[^method]


[^same]: [Richard](http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/selectedcorrespondence/sc-time2.htm): *Put succinctly: the moment ([[This Moment|this moment]]) in which event ‘A’ happens is the exact same moment ([[This Moment|this moment]]) in which event ‘B’ happens ... it is only the events which change/move/flow and not the moment itself (eternity).*

    > Your initial email – reproduced here as \#161xx further above – almost prompted me to write a comment, when you posted it, as it clearly pinpoints the difference between a caused/ conditional enjoyment (_‘I had a lot of fun tonight with friends’/ ‘all we did was sit, talk, and joke around’_) and an uncaused/ unconditional enjoyment (_‘the fascination that it is this moment sets in’/ ‘I am once more enjoying life’_).
    > 
    > (A caused, or conditional, enjoyment and appreciation has a beginning and an end – it is dependent upon situations and > circumstances – whereas an uncaused, or unconditional, enjoyment and appreciation is perpetual, aeonian (beginingless and endless) and occurs solely by virtue of being vitally alive – being dynamically here at this particular place in infinite space at this very moment in eternal time as a sensuous, reflective flesh-and-blood body only – and thus dependent upon no one, no thing, and no event).
    > 
    > Your follow-up email – reproduced here as \#161xx above – unambiguously indicates you are indeed \[quote\] _‘applying the method correctly’_ \[endquote\] and it quite remarkably reminded me of certain everyday experiences which occasioned the identity inhabiting this flesh-and-blood body all those years ago to both devise and (successfully) implement what has become known as the actualism method.

    > **What the question ‘How am I experiencing this moment of being alive?’ – which ‘he’ formulated back in early 1981 – meant to ‘him’ was ‘Why is that experience not happening at this very moment?’ or ‘What is preventing that way of being here occurring right now?’ or ‘How come that wondrous world is not currently apparent?’ (and so on and so forth)**.
    > 
    > By thus being vitally interested – with that degree of fascinated attentiveness – in this moment being the only moment ‘he’ was ever alive it soon became a wordless approach, a non-verbal attitude towards life, each moment again, and ‘he’ readily developed the knack of allowing apperception to happen as it is never not this moment (as in ‘time has no duration’/ ‘time does not move’) in actuality.
    > 
    > (The experiential knowledge that this moment is eternal – that it is **never not this moment** in actuality – is the **key to more instances of apperceptive awareness taking place**).
    > 
    > Now that you indubitably know what apperception is – as per your _‘It was undoubtedly an experience of apperception’_ sentence – and how to evoke it (as in your _‘Then as I stuck with that seeing that it was this moment of being alive I was pulled towards it. The pull itself was exhilarating and thrilling’_ sentences) you may very well **come to look back upon this day as being the turning-point of your life**, eh?
