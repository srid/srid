# Clew

:::{.page-note}
These are just some rough notes on my attempts to deliberately induce a [[PCE|PCE]].

> Incidentally, just before/ just as the [[PCE|PCE]] starts to wear off, if one unravels (metaphorically) ==a ‘golden thread’ or ‘clew’==, as one is slipping back into the real-world, *an intimate connection is thus established betwixt the pristine-purity of an actual innocence and the near-purity of the [[Sincerity|sincerity]] of [[Naivete|naiveté]]*.

While contemplating [[Never not this moment]] ...
- Can immediately taste the "arriving here" of [[pce-reports]] (aka. [[Stillness of time|stillness]])
    - Music is raw; visual ambiance is getting to be brilliant ... all the while happening more in the *now-still* "arena"
      - The concomitant stillness is very palpable; revealed via the cessation of hitherto-existant "movement"
      - <small>It is the "moving" (in time) [[Identity]] that obscures it all otherwise.</small>
- Ergo, [[Stillness of time|stillness]], as I experienced in a PCE, **is a clew**.
- The clew (or the end of it that is close to the PCE) is accessed by seeing (via [[Pure Contemplation|contemplation]] and [[Curiosity-Fascination-Obsession|curiosity]]) if [[This Moment|this moment]] _is the same_ (over time), with only events on it changing (over time).
    - Otherwise, that which appears to be changing "behind" is the [[Identity]]
    - Realizing (successfully 'seeing') it not to be changing ▶️ identity going into abeyance
