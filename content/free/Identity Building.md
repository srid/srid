[Editor's note: I identified a hitherto-unconscious pattern of human affective behaviour that involves some sort of 'building up of' one's identity, via [[Hope|hopes]], dreams and schemes. The pattern, which I call "*identity building*", becomes particularly obvious when the structure being tacitly propped up over a lifetime suddenly comes crumbling down upon life's various set backs, which misfortune to an actualist is in fact a blessing in disguise to proceed to, as Peter says, *"actively demolish and break \[it\] down"* via, instead, allowing oneself to [[Being the doing of what is happening]].]{.editor-note}

> The search for meaning amidst the debris of ==the much-vaunted human [[Hope|hopes]] and dreams and schemes== has come to its timely end. With the end of both ‘I’ and ‘me’, the distance or separation between both ‘I’ and ‘me’ and these sense organs – and thus the external world – disappears. To be living as the senses is to live a clear awareness in operation ... which is known as [[Apperception]], a [[PCE|pure consciousness experience]] of the world as-it-is. ---[A Précis Of Actual Freedom](http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/articles/aprecisofactualfreedom.htm)
