RICHARD: Which neatly brings me to the point of detailing these above examples: understanding the ‘whys and wherefores’ of ==peasant-mentality== is not about effecting social change but being free of it in oneself.

In the seventh paragraph of ‘Article 20’ (appended further below) I have highlighted the relevant sentence. Viz.:

> • \[Richard\]: Astonishingly, I find that \***social change is unnecessary**\*; I can live freely in the community as-it-is. \[endquote\].

In other words, one is then free to conform with the legal laws and observe the social protocols – to ‘go along with’, to ‘pay lip-service to’ – whilst no longer [[Belief|believing]] in them.

‘Tis a remarkable freedom in itself – with no need to rebel at all – as all rebellion stems, primarily, from that deeply-held primordial \***feeling**\* of disfranchisement (and its associated feelings of resentment, envy, cynicism, and so on and so forth).
