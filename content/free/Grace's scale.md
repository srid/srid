# Grace's scale of different ways of being

http://actualfreedom.com.au/richard/selectedcorrespondence/sc-intimacy.htm

RICHARD: In the same way that [[EE]]s (EE’s) were a notable feature of feeling-being ‘Richard’s virtual freedom experiencing circa March-September 1981, although of course not named as such back then, so too did **intimacy experiences** (IE’s) play a similarly significant role even though increasingly overshadowed by the insistent emergence of [[Love|love]] – and, especially, Love Agapé – in the later months due to a marked lack of precedence and, thus, of any praxeological[^pra] publications (nowadays made freely available on The Actual Freedom Trust web site) on ==the distinction betwixt the **near-innocent intimacy of [[Naivete|naïveté]]** and the **affectional intimacy** of romance lore and legend==.

Just as the term ‘excellence experience’ came from feeling-being ‘Grace’ – who was exacting in evaluating ‘her’ differing ways of being a ‘self’ so as to not illude herself that ‘she’ was more progressive than was really the case – so too did the expression ‘**different-way-of-being**’. What gradually became more and more apparent was that a prevailing feature of ‘her’ differing ways of being was the **degree of intimacy** involved.

The gradations of ‘her’ scale were, basically, **good, very good, great, excellent, and perfect** – whereby, in regards to intimacy, ‘**good**’ related to ==togetherness== (which pertains to being and acting in concert with another); ‘**very good**’ related to ==closeness== (where personal boundaries expand to include the other); ‘**great**’ related to ==sweetness== (delighting in the pervasive proximity, or immanence, of the other)[^other]; ‘**excellent**’ related to ==richness== (a near-absence of [[Genetic Identity|agency]]; with the [sophisticate] doer abeyant, and the [[[Naivete|naïve]]] beer ascendant, being the experiencing is inherently cornucopian); and ‘**perfect**’ related to ==magicality== (neither beer nor doer extant; pristine purity abounds and immaculate perfection prevails) – all of which correlate to the range of [[Naivete|naïveness]] from being [[Sincerity|sincere]] to becoming naïve and all the way through being naïveté itself[^ni] to an actual innocence.

- Togetherness (‘good’) is the companionship of being and doing things together – be it shopping, cooking, dining, communicating, copulating, sharing, travelling, and so on – and pertains to the willingness to be and act in concert with another in the regular connubial/ conjugal way of feeling intimate.
- Closeness (‘very good’) comes about due to feeling sufficiently safe/ feeling secure enough, emotionally, to intuitively enable an inclusive-of-the-other expansion of viscerally-determined personal boundaries; this is a normal type of intimacy wherein the regular way of feeling intimate is intensified and/or deepened.
- Sweetness (‘great’) is when closeness entrées a joyous delighting in the pervasive proximity, or immanence, of the other (it is at the onset of this stage that a bifurcation manifests whereby the [[Instinctual Treadmill|instinctual tendency/ temptation]] is to veer off in the direction of [[Love|love]] and its affectuous intimacy due to the ‘self’-centric attractiveness of feeling affectionate).
- Richness (‘excellent’) happens upon sweetness segueing into a near-absence of agency; with the controlling doer abeyant, and a naïve beer ascendant, being the experiencing of what is happening is inherently cornucopian (a.k.a. an [[EE]]).
- Magicality (‘perfect’) is whence neither beer nor doer be extant; pristine purity abounds and immaculate perfection prevails (a.k.a. a [[PCE]]).

[^other]:
    [Richard]: What did not get included in this third paragraph, regarding feeling-being ‘Grace’ and her rigorous gradations, was ‘her’ oft-repeated observation – regarding the onset of the third stage, on that range of naïveness, where ‘her’ gradation of ‘great’ related to sweetness – about a bifurcation manifesting where the instinctual tendency/ temptation was to veer off in the direction of love and its affectuous intimacy (due to a ==self-centric attractiveness towards **feeling affectionate**==) as contrasted to ==a conscious choice being required so as to somehow have that sweetness then segue into a [[Naivete|naïve]] intimacy via== what ‘she’ described as ‘richness’ and graded as ‘excellent’.

[^ni]:
    [Richard]: To be naïveté itself (i.e., naïveté embodied as ‘me’), which is to be the closest one can to innocence whilst remaining a ‘self’ (innocence is where ‘self’ is not), one is both likeable and liking for herewith lies tenderness, sweetness and togetherness, closeness whereupon moment-to-moment experiencing is of traipsing through the world about in a state of wide-eyed wonder and amazement as if a child again (guileless, artless, ingenuous, innocuous) – yet with adult sensibilities whereby the distinction betwixt being naïve and being [[Gullibility|gullible is readily separable – simply marvelling at the sheer magnificence of this oh-so-material universe’s absoluteness and unabashedly delighting in its boundless beneficence, its limitless largesse, with a blitheness and a gaiety such that the likelihood of the magical fairy-tale-like nature of this paradisaical terraqueous globe becoming ever-so-sweetly apparent, as an experiential actuality, is almost always imminent.
