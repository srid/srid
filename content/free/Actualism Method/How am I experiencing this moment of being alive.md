# How am I experiencing this moment of being alive?

[Richard]: ‘(...) It is a question, not a phrase to be memorised and repeated slogan-like (or as if chanting a mantra for instance), and it soon becomes [[Affective Awareness|a non-verbal attitude to life ... a wordless approach]] each moment again whereupon one cannot be anything else but [[Affective Awareness|(affectively) aware]] of one’s every instinctual impulse/affective feeling, and thus self-centred thought, as it is happening.

[...] ‘The words ‘how am I experiencing this moment of being alive’ simply refer the make-up of the [[Aware-Cum-Attentive|awareness-cum-attentiveness]] being applied ... as distinct from, say, the buddhistic ‘mindfulness’ (which is another ball-game entirely).

In other words the focus is upon how [[Genetic Identity|identity]] in toto is standing in the way of the already always existing peace-on-earth being apparent just [[Being here now|here]] right now.
