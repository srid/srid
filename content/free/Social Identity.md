[Topic: Social Identity](http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/library/topics/socialidentity.htm),

**Richard:** <font color="#AA0000">This social identity, which is otherwise known as a conscience (a moral/ethical and principled entity, with inculcated societal knowledge of ‘right’ and ‘wrong’), is overlaid upon the [[Genetic Identity|instinctual identity]] itself ... and its associated personae consist of (for example):</font>

<font color="#AA0000">

> 1\. A vocational identity as ‘employee’/‘employer’, ‘worker’/‘pensioner’, ‘junior/‘senior’ and so on.  
> 2\. A national identity as ‘English’, ‘American’, ‘Australian’ and etcetera.  
> 3\. A racial identity as ‘white’, ‘black’, ‘brown’ or whatever.  
> 4\. A religious/spiritual identity as a ‘Hindu’, a ‘Muslim’, a ‘Christian’, a ‘Buddhist’ ad infinitum.  
> 5\. A ideological identity as a ‘Capitalist’, a ‘Communist’, a ‘Monarchist’, a ‘Fascist’ and etcetera.  
> 6\. A political identity as a ‘Democrat’, a ‘Tory’, a ‘Republican’, a ‘Liberal’ and all the rest.  
> 7\. A family identity as ‘son’/‘daughter’, ‘brother’/‘sister’, ‘father’/‘mother’ and the whole raft of relatives.  
> 8\. A gender identity as ‘boy’/‘girl’, ‘man’/‘woman’.

Richard: A social identity is a psychological creation manufactured by society to act as a guardian over the wayward [[Genetic Identity|rudimentary self one was born with]]. All sentient beings are born with a biologically coded instinctive drive for physical survival which, when one is operating and functioning with a group of people, is potentially a danger to the survival of other group members. Hence the need for principles and morals and ethics to regulate the conduct of each person ... with appropriate rewards and punishments to ensure compliance.

In a well-meant but ultimately short-sighted effort to prevent gaols from being filled to over-flowing, a social identity – a psychological guardian – is fabricated in an earnest endeavour to prevent the offences from happening in the first place. This ‘guardian’ is programmed with a set of values and charged with the role of acting as a conscience over the wayward self. A conscience is made up of a sure knowledge of what is Right or Wrong and Good or Bad ... as determined by each society. By and large this enterprise has proved to be effective – only a small minority of citizens fail to behave in a socially acceptable manner.
