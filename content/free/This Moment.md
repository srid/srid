[On Time: This Moment, Timelessness and Eternity](http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/selectedcorrespondence/sc-time.htm),

RICHARD: One of the main keys to success is a focus on time itself as a sensate experience. My oft-repeated refrain is this: ‘The first step to being free is the actual understanding that **this moment in time is the only place where being alive happens**. The past, although it was actual when it did happen, is not actual now. The future, although it will be actual when it does happen, is [[No next moment|not actual now]]. Only now is actual and as it is always now then the purity of innocence is perpetually here already ... where **time has no duration**. Then what one is – as this body being apperceptively aware – is this material universe experiencing itself as a sensate, reflective human being. The physical space of this universe is infinite and its time is eternal ... thus the infinitude of this very material universe has no beginning and no ending ... and therefore no middle. There are no edges to this universe, which means that there is no centre, either. We are all coming from nowhere and are not going anywhere for there is nowhere to come from nor anywhere to go to. We are nowhere in particular ... which means we are anywhere at all’.

To be the consciousness of the infinitude ... it is no little thing that one does.

[Part 2](http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/selectedcorrespondence/sc-time2.htm),

RICHARD: Time itself – this eternal moment – does not flow (move) ... there is a vast [[Stillness of time|stillness]] here in this actual world.
