In contrast to [[What is time|actual time]].

[Ref](http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/selectedcorrespondence/sc-time2.htm),

RICHARD: No, I am saying that it is conventional time – **time as a measure of the sequence of events (as in past/ present/ future)** – which has no existence in actuality; [[This Moment|time itself]] (eternity), just like space (infinity), most certainly exists.

There is a vast [[Stillness of time|stillness]] here.

RICHARD: What I am saying, in the e-mail you are referring to, is that [[This Moment|time itself]] (as in durationless time/ eternal time/ beginningless and endless time) – as contrasted to **time as a measure of the sequence of events (as in past/ present/ future)** – does not move/ flow but that it is objects in (infinite) space which do.

[Editor’s Note: time itself, as is readily apparent in the actual world, is the arena (so to speak) in which events occur/in which matter permutates].

I am aware that my words are being hijacked, as it were, by an [[Genetic Identity|identity]] – and thus turned into concepts – forever locked-out of time and accordingly draw a distinction between **what the word ‘time’ refers to in the real world** (a flow or a movement of the arena, so to speak, in which events occur) and what is actually happening (it is [[Never not this moment|never not this moment]]) as a prompt for direct experience (there is a vast [[Stillness of time|stillness]] here).

Put succinctly: the moment (this moment) in which event ‘A’ happens is the exact same moment (this moment) in which event ‘B’ happens ... it is only the events which change/move/flow and not the moment itself (eternity).

Have you never noticed it is [[Never not this moment|never not this moment]]?
