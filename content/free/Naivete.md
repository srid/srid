# Naiveté

http://actualfreedom.com.au/richard/catalogue/naivete.htm

> To be naïve is to be virginal, unaffected, unselfconsciously artless ... in short: ingenuous. Naiveté is a much-maligned word, having the common assumption that it implies gullibility. Nevertheless, to be naïve means to be simple and unsophisticated. -- http://actualfreedom.com.au/library/topics/naivete.htm

> It is an effortless, almost foolish, sensation ... but exquisite. [..]

> 
> In short: if it be not either easy (effortless) or fun (enjoyable) then there is something to look at until it is again.  http://actualfreedom.com.au/richard/selectedcorrespondence/sc-naivete.htm

[Richard’s Selected Writings on The Universe](http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/selectedwriting/sw-universe.htm),

Richard: ‘One surely has to be naive to [[Pure Contemplation|contemplate]] the profound notion that this universe is benign, friendly. One needs to be naive to consider that this universe has an inherent imperative for well-being to flourish; that it has a built-in benevolence available to one who is artless, without guile. To the realist – the ‘worldly-wise’ – this appears like utter foolishness. After all, life is a ‘vale of tears’ and one must ‘make the best of a bad situation’ because one ‘can’t change human nature’; and therefore ‘you have to fight for your rights’. This derogatory advice is endlessly forthcoming; the put-down of the universe goes on ad nauseam, wherever one travels throughout the world. This universe is so enormous in size – infinity being as enormous as it can get – and so magnificent in its scope – eternity being as magnificent as it can get – how on earth could anyone believe for a minute that it is all here for humans to be forever miserable in? It is foolishness of the highest order to believe it to be so. Surely, one can have confidence in a universe so grandly complex, so marvellously intricate, so wonderfully excellent. How could all this be some ‘ghastly mistake’? To believe it all to be some ‘sick joke’ is preposterous, for such an attitude cuts one off from the perfection of this pure moment of being alive here in this fantastic actual universe.’

RICHARD: Any sense of **naiveté**, no matter how small, is to be encouraged ... and the cultivation of naiveté (the closest approximation to innocence a ‘self’ can be) via [[Sincerity|sincerity]] is, of course, enhanced by [[Delight|delighting]] in being alive on this wondrous paradise called planet earth.

In this context delight is the sensuous experience of the thrill that being a flesh and blood body automatically evokes: the delicious (physical) excitation of the senses ... all the senses tingling with utter enjoyment and exhilaration.

## Evoking naiveté

[From Peter](http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/actualism/peter/list-af/corr58a.htm#18.11.2003),

There is a lot in Richard’s writings that evokes naiveté, yet reading it is one thing but taking the time, and making the effort, to contemplate on what one reads is quite another. This is the work that is up to ‘you’ to do.

I had Richard’s journal 📖 by my bedside 🛏️ and would read a few paragraphs and then lay back and think about it a while or I would take myself off for a walk 🚶 in a favourite place and just sit down and gaze 👀 at the world with soft eyes thinking 🤔 about what I had read, what I had done with my life, what I was doing with my life and what I wanted to do with my life.

I also found it essential to stop beating myself up and start liking myself ❤️, to start to [[Your own best friend|enjoy my own company]] which in turn led me to start being interested in [[Being here now|being here]] 📆, which in turn led to a naïve [[Curiosity-Fascination-Obsession|curiosity]] about life, the universe 🌄 and what it is to be a human being.

I don’t know if that is of use to you but the first is obvious – **read** – and the second is equally important – **contemplate** – and the second will be best done at a time when you feel most relaxed and at ease.

RICHARD: Getting in touch with one’s in-built naiveté is the first step towards [[Native intelligence|sagacious reasoning]].
