Richard: To get out of ‘stuckness’ one gets off one’s backside and does whatever one knows best to activate **delight**. Delight is what is humanly possible, given sufficient pure intent obtained from the [[Felicity and Innocuity|felicity/ innocuity]] born of the [[PCE|pure consciousness experience]], and from the position of delight, one can vitalise one’s joie de vivre by the [[Curiosity-Fascination-Obsession|amazement]] at the fun of it all ... and then one can – with sufficient abandon – become over-joyed and move into marvelling at [[Being here now|being here]] and [[Being the doing of what is happening|doing this business called being alive now]]. Then one is no longer intuitively making sense of life ... the delicious wonder of it all drives any such instinctive meaning away. Such luscious wonder fosters the innate condition of [[Naivete|naiveté]] – the nourishing of which is essential if fascination in it all is to occur – and the charm of life itself easily engages dedication to peace-on-earth. Then, as one gazes intently at the world about by glancing lightly with sensuously caressing eyes, out of the corner of one’s eye comes – sweetly – the magical fairy-tale-like paradise that this verdant earth actually is ... and one is the [[Being the doing of what is happening|experiencing of what is happening]]. But refrain from possessing it and making it your own ... or else ‘twill vanish as softly as it appeared. <snip>

RESPONDENT: I have a bit of trouble summoning up **delight** (as Richard suggests), as it seems imaginary, as opposed to the release that comes with facing issues. That is still under consideration though.

RICHARD: The first sentence of above paragraph is specifically designed to get one out of ‘stuckness’ ... it is not intended as an on-going way of living life. It is a short, sharp shock of attention – a ‘kick-start’ in the jargon – to ==counteract== the ‘I didn’t ask to be born’ [[Basic Resentment|resentment]] that caused the stuckness in the first place. Another ‘wake-up jab’ (which makes use of any remnant of pride) is to ask oneself: ‘I have two choices right now: being happy and harmless or being dull and degenerate ... which way do I sensibly choose to spend this never-to-be-repeated precious moment of living so that I can honestly call myself a mature adult?’

A happy and [[Harmlessness|harmless]] person has a much better chance of precipitating a [[PCE|PCE]] ... which is the essential pre-requisite for an actual freedom (otherwise this is all theory). It goes without saying, surely, that a grumpy person locks themselves out of being here ... now.

VINEETO: Now, that my ‘self’ has lost the grip over me most of the time, I am simply doing what is happening and enjoy what I am doing. That doing may be working for people, sorting their financial affairs, writing letters, thinking something through, watching TV, redressing web-pages, cooking a meal, washing dishes, having lunch in town or lying on the couch. Having eliminated the [[Basic Resentment|basic resentment]] of ‘having to be here’, I now find that whatever I do is the **delightful** expression of being alive. Creativity or doing nothing is now all part of the same **delight** – being the universe’s experience of itself as a sensate and reflective human being.
