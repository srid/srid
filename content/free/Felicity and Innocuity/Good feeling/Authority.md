RICHARD: There are two meanings to the word **‘authority’** and
- the one that causes all the troubles is the one connected with power. 
  - (The power of the authority to enforce obedience; the power of the authority to enforce moral or legal judgements; the power of the authority to command or give the final decision; the power of the authority to control; the power of the authority of a governing body; the power of an authoritative holy book; the power of the authority to inspire [[Belief|belief]] and so on). 
- The second – less used – meaning is: an expert on a particular subject.
