# S.N.A.G.

*(S.N.A.G. is an acronym of [Sensitive New Age Guy](https://twitter.com/urbandictionary/status/902566853855154176))*

PETER: [..] the ripples I am talking of are the type that I may cause – ripples that result from my anger, frustration, peeved-ness, [[Basic Resentment|resentment]], annoyance, impatience, etc.

I wrote about it my journal –

[Peter]: ‘I remember a major turning point came for me when I realised I was causing ‘ripples’ for other people by my every action: however subtle sometimes, however unintentional, however well meaning, but ‘ripples’ nevertheless. And by seeing it I wanted it to stop! It became yet another motivation to do all I could to eliminate my ‘self’. I wanted not only peace for myself, but for others too.’ Peter’s Journal – Peace

Being a good, kind-hearted, moral and ‘caring’ man at the time it was difficult for me to see this behaviour in myself, or even acknowledge that this was ‘me’ in action, let alone want to put an end to it. For the ending of anger – causing ripples – is the ending of ‘me’. I used the term ‘causing ripples’ in my journal deliberately for I was nearly always able to control my anger – and most other emotions – and, as such, have not indulged in fights or violent acts, let alone verbal arguments, competitive sports, etc. I was **a S.N.A.G., a wimp, a pacifist, a nice guy**. When I came across Richard and his journal it was the [[Harmlessness|harmless]] in ‘happy and harmless’ that was really appealing, for I knew that ==although I was a nice guy I could not honestly say I was harmless==. In all my relationships, I knew that was as much the cause of dis-harmony as the other.
