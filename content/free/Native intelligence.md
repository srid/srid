RICHARD: One’s **native intelligence** cannot operate and function cleanly and clearly whilst [[Genetic Identity|‘I’]] am in there trying to run the show. The nearest thing to what I call native intelligence is known as commonsense in the ‘real world’. **Intuition**, be it of the NDA variety, or any other variety is affectively-based ... thus you would be relying on the notoriously unreliable feelings to be the arbiter of what is appropriate or inappropriate action.

...

RICHARD: I use the phrase **native intelligence** in the meaning of ==:diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside:‘autochthonous acumen’== or ==:diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside:‘indigenous prudence’== or ==:diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside:‘congenital judicity’==. I am meaning a down-to-earth and matter-of-fact practicality ... an innate sensibility. **Intuition** is not sensible.
