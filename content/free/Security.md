From [Richard’s Selected Writings on Time: this Moment, Timelessness and Eternity](http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/selectedwriting/sw-time.htm)

RICHARD: [[Being here now]], as this body, is to be living inside eternal time. In here lies **security, utter safety**. ==Nothing can go ultimately wrong inside [[This Moment|eternal time]], all is forever well==. It is only when one thinks and feels that _‘I’_ exist that the troubles begin. To locate this entity, one has only to tune into the feeling of _‘being’_. In _‘being’_ there is a sense of _‘presence’_, a feeling of being present. [..]

To be an entity is to be forever locked-out of eternal time. ==**Complete security** lies inside eternal time==. _‘I’_ will never look into eternal time; for _‘me’_ eternal time is an enemy to be avoided at all costs. _‘I’_ condemn _‘myself’_ to the endless [[Identity Building|creation of grandiose schemes]] to save my _soul_; _‘I’_ concoct all kinds of fantasies about _Other-Worldly Dimensions. ‘I’_ have to believe in multitudinous _Heavenly Kingdoms_ wherein _‘I’_ can reside as an _Immaculate Spirit_ for all of _Eternity. ‘I’_ am driven to [[Identity Building|spin dreams and illusions]] because _‘I’_ refuse to see what lies here on earth ... right under _‘my’_ nose, as it were. _‘I’_ can never live inside eternal time … whereas I as this flesh and blood body can only be here now. Inside this body there is no _‘being’_ … nothing psychological or psychic left for _‘I’_ am extinct. Time is a blessing, not a curse. I can never be out of time, nor anywhere but here, for I have actualised my destiny … here on earth and now in time.

From [Infinitude Is The Boundlessness Of Space And Time](http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/audiotapeddialogues/infinitudeistheboundlessness.htm):

RICHARD: [..] it is perfect the universe can ‘do its thing’ with absolute certainty. We can rely upon its certainty through memory, which is the history of events, and see that there is a consistency to events. The sun rises each morning and sets each evening. That is reliable, and we can make plans accordingly. If the sun did not rise tomorrow we would not be alive to know that it did not. Therefore, there is dependability born out of the perfection. Ultimately nothing can go wrong – and this is where **security** lies. I could break a leg or get a disease, which causes discomfort, but it is not an indication that life is ‘going wrong’.

This is the peculiar part about an actual freedom. **Utter security**. The ==absolute certainty that nothing can go wrong in an ultimate sense== brings completion. This is perfection ... but not in the human concept of perfection. For them perfection means disease-free.

From [Selected Correspondence Vineeto Belonging](http://actualfreedom.com.au/actualism/vineeto/selected-correspondence/corr-belonging.htm):

VINEETO: [..] belonging is about _feeling_ part of a group for emotional support, for **security** of one’s [[Belief|beliefs]] and for company in loneliness and misery. I have experienced and examined my beliefs, emotions, instinctual passions, urges, needs and fears around this issue in me and they no longer have any impact on me.

I don’t belong to any group and I have dared to ==acknowledge the fact that I am on my own== – in fact, I as this flesh-and-blood body ==have been on my own all my life== despite my feelings of belonging or not belonging. For the path to an actual freedom I rely on my own [[PCE|pure consciousness experiences]] to know what I want to achieve and I found that the [[Actualism Method|method of actualism]] works to make me happy and [[Harmlessness|harmless]]. There is neither [[Belief|belief]] nor devotion nor [[Gratitude|gratitude]] nor **security** nor following an **authority** figure – none of these emotional needs and bondages exist anymore.

From [Richard’s Selected Correspondence On Humanity](http://actualfreedom.com.au/richard/selectedcorrespondence/sc-humanity.htm):

RICHARD: With [[Apperception|apperception]], what one discovers, time and again, is that the **personal boundaries** that one feels so safely protected by, are made up of ‘my’ accrued [[Belief|beliefs]] as to who ‘I’ am. This is ‘my’ outline, as it were, shaped by other people’s description of ‘me’ ... a construct which gives ‘me’ asylum in each different group into which ‘I’ wish to enter. Yet the outline of this construct creates, simultaneously, an enormous distance between ‘me’ and the world outside. At those times of [[PCE|peak experience]], the distance disappears all of a sudden as ‘I’ vanish and this world is right here, so close that there is no distance any more. This is closer than any affective intimacy ‘I’ have ever longed for. This is serendipity indeed. This is a direct experience of actuality ... and I have always been here like this ... so **safely** here. The outline, the boundary that created the distance, was all in ‘my’ reality. ==‘I’ created a **substitute security** for this **original safety**== ... a safety which has never known any threat, nor ever will. This genuine safety has no need for precautions.

[..] To defend the [[Belief|belief]] that this life is forever fatally flawed – defend to the point of idiocy – is actually a cowardly attempt to stay hidden inside ‘humanity’. To skulk behind a sick social contract is a desperate ploy to remain ‘human’. If one takes one’s intellectual ability back from the [[Social Identity|decrees of the cultured sophisticates]] – to which one has surrendered – one has taken a courageous step. One has cast oneself out of the biggest group there is ... humanity. If one stays within the group, for its **perceived safety and security**, one is selling out to the system because of a pusillanimous character.

From [Richard’s Selected Writings on The Third Alternative](http://actualfreedom.com.au/richard/selectedwriting/sw-thirdalternative.htm):

RICHARD: It is so easy to live, here. All this that is happening is ==self-evidently well organising itself==. **Insecurity and security** have given way to a **vast safety** unparalleled in the annals of history.

From [Richard’s Selected Writings on The Human Condition](http://actualfreedom.com.au/richard/selectedwriting/sw-humancondition.htm):

RICHARD: [..] the eternal cry of each group-member, each _identity,_ is: ‘But what about me? You only love me for what I do, for what role I play, for my looks, for my bank-balance ... or for whatever attribute that has **secured** my place. I want to be loved for me, a unique individual!’ Yet this ‘unique individual’ only knows itself as a group-member. It defends itself as being part of the whole. All that area of _‘myself’_ which cannot be displayed publicly must be kept secret. _‘My’_ deepest feelings, _‘my’_ objections, _‘my’_ goals, must be suppressed in order not to upset the status-quo of the group ... and therefore, _‘my’_ precious ‘safety’. Their [[Love|love]] for _‘me’_, their acceptance, is paramount. _‘I’_ must sell-out me as-I-am in order to belong. This is _‘my’_ uneasy perversion. _‘I’_ would rather carry on being corrupted – and corrupting others – than risk the dreaded loneliness resulting from the loss of [[Love|love]] and its implied **security** through alienation from the group to which _‘I’_ belong.

From [Selected Writings from Peter’s Journal on our Animal Instincts in the Primitive Brain](http://actualfreedom.com.au/actualism/peter/selected-writings/instincts.htm):

PETER: Even if a woman had a man, this offered no **security**, so she had to continuously hone and test her seductive powers on other men in case they were needed at any time. She knew that when these powers failed, when beauty faded, when old age set in, she was useless, on the scrap heap. This behaviour is all too evident in current times: women’s magazines bear testimony to this, with their endless beauty and seductive tips. The threat of failure or loss of male protection meant that the support of the other women around the campfire was all she could ultimately fall back on; hence the woman’s loyalty to the ‘sisterhood’ is much stronger than her loyalty to her man.

From [Richard’s Correspondence On Mailing List ‘D’ with Correspondent No. 25](http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/listdcorrespondence/listd25.htm):

• [Respondent]: ‘Some thoughts on what it means to be ‘spiritual’. On the one hand, being ‘spiritual’ can mean believing in a god, truth (by whatever name), the afterlife, etc. i.e. – belief in the supernatural. On the other hand, being ==‘spiritual’== can refer to an attitude or outlook on life which values such things as family, community and community service, a feeling of unity with the universe and all peoples and beings. It is this second sense of the word ‘spiritual’ that everyone inevitably shares to some extent. As a feeling being ‘I’ cannot help but attempt to unite my ‘self’ with other ‘selves’ for **security and fortification**. It is ‘my’ very nature to do so. [...snip...]. Not too long ago, I attended a single Humanist meeting. I was surprised to find out that on the one hand, spiritual beliefs were shunned as primitive belief, yet ‘spirituality’ (as in community, connection with all beings, etc) was quite important.

So, even in a room where I presume were mostly atheists, spirituality was accepted and sacrosanct. As I see it, this is the reason why it is a important insight that virtually everyone is ‘spiritual’ at least in their desire to connect with others, the truth, the universe, or whatever. It is the ‘real’ existence of the psychic web which makes the feeling of unity possible and the search for this unity in whatever form the essence of the ‘spiritual’.

• [Richard]: ‘There are times where I am particularly pleased when something comes into my mail-box ... this is one of them’.

From [Descriptions of Pure Consciousness Experiences](http://actualfreedom.com.au/actualism/others/corr-pce.htm):

[00K]: The experience of [[Stillness of time|stillness]]w was actually very profound and gave this **security** that I can’t explain very well.

[No.50]: In the [[PCE|PCEs]] this emotion/ feeling distance barrier (the self) dissolved and affected the way I (physically) experienced [[This Moment|time]], space and objects. In the PCEs ==the **security or confidence** instilled by (physical) location in eternal time and infinite space== is unmistakable. Everything exists in an absolute [[Stillness of time|stillness]] and deep purity. Visually, the contrast of light and dark is heightened, colours are richer. Hearing is unrestricted, sounds are welcome. I could feel the nubbly fabric of the chair on my skin and I remember thinking I was in forbidden territory, that I was breaking a big taboo because everything was so easy and o.k. [..] Time is one big, long eternal moment of [[Stillness of time|stillness]]. All the time in the universe is available for me to operate in.
