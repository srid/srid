# Out-from-Control, Different Way of Being

From the tooltip after "*as distinct from the actualism method*" in http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/listdcorrespondence/listd12.htm#09Dec09a

**RICHARD**: [..] the [[Actualism Method|actualism method]] segues into what has become known as the ==actualism process== when the actualism method has become so automatic, via habituation, that one is walking about in a state of wide-eyed wonder ([[Naivete|naiveté]]) simply marvelling at being alive ([[Sensuousness|sensuosity]]) and being [[Curiosity-Fascination-Obsession|amazed]]/ [[Delight|delighted]] that all this – the world about/the universe itself – is occurring in the first place; the actualism process is when it becomes more and more difficult to distinguish the difference between one doing it (doing this business called being alive) and it happening of its own accord; when one [[Being the doing of what is happening|becomes the experiencing of being alive/of it all occurring of its own accord]] one is then out-from-control (not ‘out of control’ as in wayward) and a different-way-of-being has ensued.  

It all becomes rather magical (‘magical’ as in prestidigitation) after that.
