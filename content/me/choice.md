# The choice to be happy

[**WORK IN PROGRESS**]{.page-note .text-xl}

Every normal human being has the unrealized ability to **choose** to [[Feeling good|feel good]]. This ability remains unutilized only because of our normal dissociative awareness. 

The **normal dissociative awareness** is what makes us feel as if we "have" feelings, rather than be aware of the fact we *are* our feelings (see [['I' am 'my' feelings and 'my' feelings are 'me']]). And because both the "haver" (split-self), and the "being had" feelings that it is trying to control, are one and the same, it results in one being _powerless_ to effectuate any change in one's mood. Hence, it is considered impossible to absolutely control one's feelings.

Feelings and moods of course do not reliably change via conscious *control*. They do change, nevertheless, and there is an effective way to institute that change such that one is [[Feeling good|feeling good]], as a baseline, 24x7. While "you" cannot _control_ how "you" feel, it is "your" _choice_ as to how "you" feel [[This Moment|right now]].

## Step 1: Undissociate yourself

The first step is go past the normal dissociative awareness. The signs of this everyday dissociation involves: fighting the feeling, denying it, wanting to get rid of it, and even blaming the situation or the people involved. There is an implicit discomfort in simply _being_ those feelings. This is what must be addressed first. 

In order to address it, you must begin by radically accepting it. [Do the opposite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CizwH_T7pjg). *[[Affective Awareness|Fully-feel]]* the feeling while [[keep your hands in your pockets|not expressing it]]. _Allow_ yourself to feel it. Do not resist it or push it away. Fully _welcome_ it. *Be* that feeling ... until you see, experientially, that "you" are "your" feelings and vice-versa (they are indistinguisable).

For eg., if you are feeling sad, arrive at a point where you are comfortable with *being* sad (and not trying to push it away); you will eventually discover and say to yourself: "I *am* sadness" (and not that I "have" a feeling of sadness).

## Step 2: Unearth the causes 

Although this step is generally optional, it becomes necessary for recurring patterns of feelings. Once you have fully accepted and realized that "you" are "sadness" (they are indistinguishable), for instance, but the feeling still remains - then the **psychic scuba-diving** business starts. Go "down", as it were, in your psyche to unearth (i.e.: become aware of) the psychic contents that _underly_ the sadness itself. Find out what is sustaining it. But remember, do it without resisting or pushing away the feeling -- the sadness itself is put into a bind, while you do this psychic search-and-destroy mission. You may come across beliefs, expectations, complexes, entrenched habits so on and so forth. Become aware of them all. All of this is what "you" are made of. You are finding out how "you" tick. You may well find all of this to be a curious and a fascinating process, which fascination is essential for success to occur.

At one point, your [[Native intelligence|intelligence]] will automatically notice how all of this is [[Seeing the silliness|silly]]. Right then, that feeling of sadness (along with the unearthed parts and pieces of "you") will begin to dissipate away, and it does so without any voluntary control. A (tacit intelligent) "**choice**" is being made, and before you know it you are back to [[Feeling good|feeling good]].
