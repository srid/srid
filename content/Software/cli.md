# Make CLI Great Again ðŸš€

An ongoing project to get back to a CLI-centric workflow.

## Topics

* Neovim: https://github.com/srid/nixos-config/blob/master/home/neovim.nix
* Email: https://github.com/srid/nixos-config/blob/master/home/email.nix

## Motivation

- Get acquainted with CLI editing and workflows.
- Why neovim?
  - VSCode can be sluggish. 
  - Hack editor extensions in Haskell (see [nvim-hs](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/nvim-hs))
      - Maybe even write a first-class [Emanote](https://emanote.srid.ca/) extension.
- CLI email workflows: for more efficient processing (and scripting) of email
