[[Haskell]] programmers like me who have gotten used to functional programming and static typing find JavaScript to be painful to use. We can't avoid JavaScript entirely -- there are some useful JS libraries out there in the world -- however for actual app development we can continue using *safer* programming languages (see below) via either a JS-transpiler or a [Wasm](https://webassembly.org/)-compiler.

[^nofp]: Quoting Michael Snoyman, however, "*Rust is not a functional programming language, itâ€™s imperative; [...] Rust does adhere to many of the tenets of functional programming; [...] In many cases, you can easily, naturally, and idiomatically write Rust in a functional style*" https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2018/10/is-rust-functional/
