### Criticism

> An important aspect of inclusivity is being able to accommodate a diversity of opinions. If we can only get along when everyone agrees, then we cannot be diverse or inclusive. While our [[woke|preference for consensus]] has served us well in some areas, it has also **caused problems**. Our culture of avoiding conflict rather than resolving it is unhealthy and has led to **dysfunctional governance**. --[17 September 2022: Ten challenges for Rust](https://www.ncameron.org/blog/ten-challenges-for-rust/)

#### Discussions

In 2020, the forum post titled [Rust says tech will* always be political](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/rust-says-tech-will-always-be-political/43627) - discussed the Rust core team publicly promulgating their [[Luxury beliefs]] around American culture wars as if to speak on behalf of the members of the wider community.

A year later another, in August 2021, [post](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/worries-about-tech-always-being-political-statement-by-rust-team/63272?u=srid) was made by another member which immediately got locked by a moderator.
