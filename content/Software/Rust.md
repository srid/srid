### Criticism

> An important aspect of inclusivity is being able to accommodate a diversity of opinions. If we can only get along when everyone agrees, then we cannot be diverse or inclusive.

Our culture of avoiding conflict rather than resolving it is unhealthy and has led to **dysfunctional governance**. --[17 September 2022: Ten challenges for Rust](https://www.ncameron.org/blog/ten-challenges-for-rust/)
