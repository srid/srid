Although Markdown is good enough for [[Zettelkasten]], wikis and such (cf. [[Emanote]]), for writing *outline* content Org Mode in [[Emacs]] shines the best.

For parsing org files in [[Haskell]], checkout [`org-parser`](https://github.com/lucasvreis/org-parser) by lucasvreis ... as well as the [[Ema]] app [abacateiro](https://github.com/lucasvreis/abacateiro) by the same author.
