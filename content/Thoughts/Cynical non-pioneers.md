It appears there does not exist suitable antonym for the word "pioneer"[^def]. The closest that exists, as far as I can tell, is the [Plato's Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave) metaphor. Baring a suitable word that gets suggested to me, I will use "Cynical non-pioneers" to refer to such peoples.

[^def]: *a person who is among the first to research and develop a new area of knowledge or activity*

## Cynicism of non-pioneers ...

A non-pioneer is merely someone that is not a pioneer (in whatever field/ idea). A *cynical* non-pioneer is one that *obdurately resists* that new thing using spurious reasons, thus exhibiting a cynical outlook. One of the things that prevents people from adopting a new idea in general is cynicism or doubt. How does it manifest in various domains?

### ... in tech

Here are some examples of [[Naive Optimism|cynicism]] exhibited by non-enthusiastic "outsiders" (non-[[Stay niche|niche]] population) in tech:

- [Getting downvoted](https://old.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/y6a07e/simple_ghc_stack_for_a_novice/iso56t8/) when recommending [[Nix]] in [[Haskell]] community.
- Ad hominem accusations of [being "religious" or "bullying" or "smug"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33433783)[^fp-criticaster] when someone recommends or encourages the use of functional programing (e.g. [[Haskell]]) to them.

[^fp-criticaster]: 
    From the comment by user "kstenerud":
    
    > What's interesting to notice about this thread is how many messages are just oozing with **smug superiority and disdain** for anyone who doesn't share their knowledge. 

    The cynicism characterization comes from the fact that the person (kstenerud) who wrote the top-level thread engages in the [projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_projection) of one's own feelings of offense (else, the author can surely and readily reference those specific words that connoted "*smug superiority and disdain*") rather than discussing the merits of the topic at hand.

    "Gatekeeping" is another fancy word used elsewhere to express this felt offense, making it pass for a factoid.

    The author even goes to the extent of condescendingly claiming to read the minds of the people involved (FP proponents) better than those people themselves can by exclaiming, "*I don't think they can even see what they've become.*" when the fact of the matter simply is that "*what they've become*" is nothing but a cynical creation of this person's mind (else, the author can surely and readily reference those specific words that connoted “*smug superiority and disdain*”) which projection is then [introjected](https://archive.is/rUiwZ#selection-187.47-205.10) by other such criticasters and naysayers as evidenced by the place this factoid holds in the hierarchy of comments.

    None of this is unique to functional programming per see. When something new is presented to humanity, the initial tendency generally is to resist it at all costs. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave
