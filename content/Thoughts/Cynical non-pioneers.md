I wish there existed a suitable antonym for the word "pioneer"[^def]. The closest that exists, as far as I can tell, is the [Plato's Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave) metaphor. Baring a suitable word that gets suggested to me, I will use "Cynical non-pioneers" to refer to such peoples.

[^def]: *a person who is among the first to research and develop a new area of knowledge or activity*

## Cynicism of non-pioneers ...

One of the things that prevents people from adopting a new idea is cynicism or doubt. How does it manifest in various domains?

### ... in tech

Here are some examples of [[Naive Optimism|cynicism]] exhibited by non-enthusiastic "outsiders" (non-[[Stay niche|niche]] population) in tech:

- [Getting downvoted](https://old.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/y6a07e/simple_ghc_stack_for_a_novice/iso56t8/) when recommending [[Nix]] in [[Haskell]] community.
- Ad hominem accusations of [being "religious" or "bullying" or "smug"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33433783) when recommending functional programing (e.g. [[Haskell]]) to others.
