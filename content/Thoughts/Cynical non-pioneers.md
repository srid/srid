I wish there existed a suitable antonym for the word "pioneer" (a person who is among the first to explore or settle a new country or area). The closest that exists, as far as I can tell, is [Plato's Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave) metaphor.

## Cynicism of non-pioneers ...

### ... in tech

Here are some examples of [[Naive Optimism|cynicism]] exhibited by non-enthusiastic "outsiders" (non-[[Stay niche|niche]] population) in tech:

- [Getting downvoted](https://old.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/y6a07e/simple_ghc_stack_for_a_novice/iso56t8/) when recommending [[Nix]] in [[Haskell]] community.
- Ad hominem accusations of [being "religious" or "bullying" or "smug"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33433783) when recommending functional programing (e.g. [[Haskell]]) to others.
