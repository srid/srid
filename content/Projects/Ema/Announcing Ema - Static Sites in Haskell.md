**tldr**: Announcing [Ema](https://ema.srid.ca/), a new static site generator in Haskell with hot reload destined to develop an unique kind of apps. This post mostly goes over the background of choosing to create it.
:::

A little over a year ago I created the [rib](https://github.com/srid/rib) static site generator in [[Haskell]] based on [Shake](https://shakebuild.com/) and [[ghcid]]. The idea was to be able to write a more intuitive (so no Makefile-like rules) set of instructions for building a static site, in a type-safe language while enabling quick recompilation cycle that [[ghcid]] provided, all made reproducible in [[Nix]].

Later that year I built [[Neuron]] (note-taking system and for publishing for Markdown files as a static site) on top of rib and announced it (see [[Announcing Neuron - Zettelkasten in Haskell]]). Neuron has the ability to monitor changes to Markdown files and update the static site. After modifying your notes you would however have to manually refresh the browser.

I explored the idea of hot-reload'ing the notebook view instantly on Markdown file change in [[ka Project]]. You can see a [video demo of it here](https://ka.srid.ca/Ka.html). Likewise, the [[emanote.obelisk Project]] -- another brief exploration -- also supported hot reload. But both these projects were not static sites, and they were built on [[Reflex-FRP]] and [[Obelisk]]. I also recently got to play with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) for creating static sites, and its hot reload feature in particular impressed me; however I'm no fan of using a *less safe* language (see [[No JavaScript]]), so I wanted to take the best aspects of these projects and prototype something in Haskell.[^fsharp]

[^fsharp]: At first I attempted to [do it](https://github.com/srid/Feather) in F#; see [[A brief FSharp exploration]].

I decided to meld the ideas explored in the aforementioned projects and thereby create a *more general* static site generator that supports hot-reload as well as enables creation of applications like Neuron. Today **I'm announcing it: [Ema](https://ema.srid.ca/)**. Here's a quick demo:

The project website [ema.srid.ca](https://ema.srid.ca/) is generated by Ema itself. You can hack on it locally with IDE support by using the [source here](https://github.com/srid/ema-docs). 

It is worth emphasizing that I designed Ema to facilitate a *new model* of application development -- one where the data is managed and edited *outside* of the application itself (such as in text editors, or even a database), but the *view* of the data is provided by the application. [[Neuron]] is a great example of that (and it might well be eventually rewritten on top of Ema; EDIT: [[Emanote|indeed it is]]). Another example is writing a diary / journal view on top of org-mode daily notes, which is what I'm exploring in the [orgself](https://github.com/srid/orgself) project that also uses Ema. A [third example](https://github.com/srid/ema/issues/10) is to take a OPML file and present a daily-digest view of new content from the RSS feeds; the application would provide only a "view" into your data, which is a XML file that you may edit however you see fit. I like this model of apps, because the data and the data format remains under my control, all the while yet I'm not limited when it comes to _presentation_ of that data, and I think the web is a great platform for the later.
