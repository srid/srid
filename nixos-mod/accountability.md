Some time during 2023 since [[nixos-mod|the blog post]] was published, a number of comments in the "Moderation Team Accountability Issues" thread[^ghi] got censored[^censor] by the moderators. Fortunately, someone who had archived the original uncensored[^censor] version has provided it to me informing me of the recent censorship; it can be accessed [[accountability-thread.html|here]].

[^ghi]: For the GitHub issue that preceded this, see https://github.com/NixOS/moderation/issues/14

Among the [13 deleted comments](https://gist.github.com/srid/58e5bcbe66f16b099411683cce1060d4) is one by the self-professed manipulator[^joemanip], schmuck[^schmuck] and reclusive[^joeloner] Sven Slootweg (joepie91) containing the bizzare accusation that *"srid’s post is a bigoted screed that is exactly the sort of thing written by people who - quite literally - intend to murder us marginalized folks, or wish for others to do so."* as well as a response from Jonathan Ringer (jonringer) calling it out, viz.:

> [Jon Ringer]: In the reverse, “the average contributor doesn’t feel safe knowing that they can be silenced, suspended, or banned for not exemplifying a particular world view point”.
> 
> It’s one thing if srid was inciting violence; but as far I can tell (which hasn’t been too much research), he is proclaiming dissatisfaction with “wokeism” (which includes many viewpoints). Extrapolating this to be “the sort of thing written by people who - quite literally - intend to murder us” seems disingenuous.
> 
> On a related note, having srid change aspects of this social media and blog site to prevent a ban action infers that contributing to NixOS may also include someone looking through your internet presence to find anything they may disagree with.
> 
> Whatever happen to, “I don’t agree with srid, but thankful for his contributions”. This kind of radicalization and stereotyping of individuals isn’t healthy for either side; if anything, it just creates more animosity. If this animosity continues, I feel like the Nix community will fragment, and that will be a huge paradigm shift as efforts to improve nix will be secondary to uphold a hegemony.

[^censor]: censor (Oxford Dictionary): *officially examine (writing, artistic work, etc.) and suppress or remove any parts that are considered obscene, politically unacceptable, or a threat to security*

[^joemanip]: As a matter of related interest, Sven Slootweg (joepie91) is a self-professed [[Gullibility|manipulator]]. From https://archive.is/1xMuv
    > \[joepie\]: In case it hasn't become obvious to you yet, I am a social engineer. Full-time. 24/7. I use manipulation and other psychological tactics in nearly every conversation I have. I will try to change the way you think, and try to solve problems you might not even realize you had. 

[^joeloner]: As admitted [on May 17, 2024](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/lix-an-independent-variant-of-the-nix-package-manager/44975/28):
    > \[joepie91\]: a significant number of people, me included, cannot actually do video calls, and find text-based messaging to be significantly more accessible. **We do not derive comfort or safety from video calls**, it just makes an environment inaccessible to us.
