Some time during 2023 since [[nixos-mod|the blog post]] was published, a number of comments in the "Moderation Team Accountability Issues" thread got censored[^censor] by the moderators. Fortunately, someone who had archived the original uncensored[^censor] version has provided it to me informing me of the recent censorship; it can be accessed [[accountability-thread.html|here]].

Among the roughly 13 deleted comments is one by a certain Sven Slootweg (joepie91) containing the bizzare accusation that *"sridâ€™s post is a bigoted screed that is exactly the sort of thing written by people who - quite literally - intend to murder us marginalized folks, or wish for others to do so."* as well as a response from Jonathan Ringer (jonringer) calling it out.

[^censor]: censor (Oxford Dictionary): *officially examine (writing, artistic work, etc.) and suppress or remove any parts that are considered obscene, politically unacceptable, or a threat to security*
