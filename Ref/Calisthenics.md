# :bicyclist: Calisthenics

Physical fitness was never a priority for me growing up in the metropolitan
[Chennai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai). South Asians in general do not prioritize
fitness as much as other endeavors \(like academic success\) which may explain
why they tend to have [less favorable body
composition](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4821815/) and exhibit
[increased risk](https://www.masalastudy.org) for heart disease. I had bad
posture, and was not using all of the body muscles to their full efficiency.

## Fitness industry is a sham

I started by lifting weights in the gym \(my apartment had one\). However once this [[unfree|orthodox]] part of the Occidental culture soon revealed its insipid nature, it naturally lead me to the world of **calisthenics**. I think the whole fitness industry is overrated, and the general population should avoid it like plague.

## Strength vs Hypertrophy

I realized that my actual goal is to develop _functional_ strength---the strength one gains from
resistance training should translate to everyday physical activities that we
take for granted---otherwise, what's the point? Hypertrophy \(beyond the necessary level to achieve the
desired strength\) however is an anti-goal; It is fatuous to carry all that
extra muscle around and then ravenously eat more to maintain it.

> When strength, not hypertrophy, is the goal you maintain a lean physique.
Like Kohei Uchimura - who, incidentally, [eats one meal a day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKXOBxcNF3E).

As a result of doing calisthenics I noticed that "normal" activities like walking, 
standing, carrying, etc. became *more efficient*, in that my posture had dramatically improved
owing to the direct translation of intent, and eventual habituation, to maintain the
correct body alignment, against gravity, \(which is what one means by "correct form"\) throughout
any movement.

## Natural routine

Nowadays I tend practice a technique known as [greasing the
groove](https://sealgrinderpt.com/blog/navy-seal-workout/pavels-grease-the-groove-gtg.html/) enabling practice (with calisthenics and kettlebells; cf. Pavel Tsatsouline) on a daily basis. Sometimes I'll cease practicing it entirely for a few days. From time to time when the mood strikes me I partake in intensive activities like an hour or two of gardening, cycling or a long walk.
